<H1>Getting started with FloPoCo</H1>

<P>Welcome to new developers!</P>

<P>If you are unfamiliar with the cmake system, there is
little to learn, really. When adding .hpp and .cpp files to the
project, you will need to edit CMakeLists.txt. It is probably going
to be straightforward, just do some imitation of what is already
there. Anyway cmake is well documented. 
</P>

<P>In FloPoCo, everything is an Operator. Go read Operator.hpp first. 
</P>

<P>Operator is a virtual class. For an example of simple
Operator, go read IntAdder. Addition is written as + in modern VHDL,
but the class IntAdder implements adders pipelined to arbitrary
frequency, so you'll get an idea on how FloPoCo implements
frequency-directed pipelining. 
</P>

<P>For a more complex class with subcomponents, go read
FPAdder. It instantiates several IntAdders, leading zero counters and
shifters, asks them their pipeline depth, then builds its own pipeline
out of this information. There should be a figure in the doc/Figures
directory. This class is also an example of the best way to write a
single code for both a pipelined operator and the combinatorial
version.</P>

<P>To understand the command line, go read main.cpp. It is
not the part we are the most proud of, but it does the job.</P>

<P>The rest is arithmetic! 
</P>

<P>And do not hesitate to contact us: Florent.de.Dinechin,
à ens-lyon.fr</P>

<H2>FloPoCo Coding Standards</H2>
<P>As
the complexity and size of this project increase, it feels necessary
to define a set of coding rules and guidelines in order to have a
clean an consistent code. 
</P>

<H3>File Names</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><P>The extensions should be .hpp/.cpp for C++
		headers/code. 
	 </P>
  <LI><P>C++ files should have the same name and case
		than the class they contain. For example class FPAdder should be
		declared in file FPAdder.hpp and implemented in FPAdder.cpp. 
	 </P>
</UL>

<H3>Stylistic conventions</H3>

<UL>
  <LI><P>Source code should use <B>UTF8</B> character set.</P>
  <LI><P>Variable names and comments
	should be in <B>English</B>. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Class names are nouns, in mixed-case, with
	an initial upper-case letter and the ﬁrst letter of each
	subsequent word capitalized (e.g. TestBench). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Method names are verbs or nouns
	in <B>mixed-case, starting with a lower-case letter </B>(e.g.
	update() or addElement()). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Methods that return a value should
	take the form getSize(). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The <B>names of local variables</B> should
	be in mixed case, starting with a lower-case letter (e.g.
	countDepth). This also applies to the formal parameters of methods.
	<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Do not use names starting with underscore</FONT>.
		</P>
	<LI><P>Private and protected data member names must
	end with underscore &quot;_&quot;</P>
	<LI><P>The names of macros or <CODE>static const</CODE>
	should be all upper-case words, separated by underscore: 
	</P>
	<PRE STYLE="border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.1cm">
#define MIN_WIDTH 3
static const string VERSION = &quot;0.8&quot;;</PRE>

	<LI> <P>Indentation should be done
		 with <B>tabs</B>, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">not
			spaces</FONT>. This allows each developers to use his
		 favorite indent size without changing the code.
	  </P>
	<LI><P>Preferred layout for braces: </P>
	  <PRE STYLE="border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.1cm">
void MyClass::myMethod(int x){
  if (x&gt;10){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Some text&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
}</PRE>

<LI><P>When wrapping lines from long function calls,
where the wrapped line does not start at the same level of
indentation as the start of the function call, tab up to the start of
the function call, and then use spaces to the opening parenthesis. 
</P>
<PRE  STYLE="border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.1cm">
[--tab-][--tab-][--tab-]someFunction(param, ...
[--tab-][--tab-][--tab-][  spaces   ]moreparams, ...);</PRE>

	<LI><P><I>enums</I> should follow the QT
	conventions. i.e. CamelCase with First letter capitalization for
	both enum type and enum values. Should be document with doxygen. The
	/**&lt; tag */ can be used to add descriptions on the same line as
	an enum value, e.g. 
	  <PRE STYLE="border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.1cm">
/** @enum EnumName Here is a description of the enum *
enum EnumName {
   EnumValueOne,  /**&lt; Some doxygen description of EnumValueOne */
   EnumValueTwo,  /**&lt; Some doxygen description of EnumValueTwo */
   EnumValueThree /**&lt; Some doxygen description of EnumValueThree */
};
</PRE>
</UL>



<H3>Doxygen Comments </H3>
<P>FloPoCo source code should be documented with
<A HREF="http://www.stack.nl/%7Edimitri/doxygen/index.html">Doxygen</A>.
From Doxygen webpage: 
</P>
<P><I>&quot;Doxygen is a documentation system for
	 C++, C, Java, [...] It can generate an on-line documentation browser
	 (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) from a set
	 of documented source files. [...] The documentation is extracted
directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the
documentation consistent with the source code. [...] You can also
visualize the relations between the various elements by means of
include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration
diagrams, which are all generated automatically.</I> 
</P>
<P>(Quote extracted from the Sellarium Project
webpage)</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">All public and protected
classes and methods from FloPoCo should be fully documented in the
headers (.hpp). </FONT>
</P>
<P>There are different ways to comment C++ code with
Doxygen, in FloPoCo use the following for headers files: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.1cm">
/**
&nbsp;* Adds a TestCase to this TestCaseList. 
   Detailled description
&nbsp;*@param t TestCase to add<
&nbsp;*/
void add(TestCase t);
</PRE>

<P>Brief descriptions are single line only, and stop
at the first full stop (period). Any subsequent sentences which occur
before @param or a similar tag are considered to be part of a
detailed description. 
</P>


<H3>Stylistic conventions for generated VHDL</H3>

... may be formalized some day. Currently, the main advice is to use helper functions of the  Operator class as much as possible.
