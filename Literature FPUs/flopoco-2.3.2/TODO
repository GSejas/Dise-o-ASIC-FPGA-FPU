TODO file for FloPoCo

Testbench
* Bug on outputs that are bits with isBus false and  multiple-valued  
	(see the P output of Collision in release 2.1.0)
* Multiple valued outputs should always be intervals, shouldn't they?


Pipeline framework, Operator and Targets:
* add FPU object and remove all global variables, to enable library build
* add semantic support of fixed-point to Signal
* fix obvious memory leaks

Collision
* manage infinities etc
* decompose into FPSumOf3Squares and Collision


FPLog:
* Fix a few remaining last-bit accuracy problems, damn.
* compare with polynomial-based version.

FPExp:
* Everybody wants less-than-single-precision

HOTBM:
* true FloPoCoization, pipeline
* better (DSP-aware) architectural exploration

ConstMult:
* group KCM and shift-and-add in a single OO hierearchy (selecting the one with less hardware)
* For FPConstMult, don't output the LSBs of the IntConstMult 
   but only their sticky
* Try left to right and right to left; try variations of the initial recoding
* more clever, Lefevre-inspired algorithm
* Use DSP: find the most interesting constant fitting on 18 bits
* compare with Spiral.net and Gustafsson papers
* Implement the continued fraction stuff for FPCRConstMult

SumOfProducts, LongAcc
* add test bench generation

Shifters
* provide finer spec, see the TODOs inside Shifter.cpp

General
* Doxygenize while it's not too late

********************************************************************

Tentative roadmap 
(minor version number count, more or less, the number of working operators. 
We have left  0.xx for 1.xx when all the basic operators have been backported with working pipeline):

Version 0.1: IntConstMult, FPConstMult, FPCRConstMult
Version 0.4: LongAccumulator, FPMultiplier
Version 0.5 : HOTBM integration 
Version 0.6 : FPLog
Version 0.7 : FPExp
Version 0.8 : DotProduct
Version 0.9 : LNS operators, thanks to Sylvain Collange
Version 0.11: FPDiv, IntSquarer, new pipeline framework
Version 1.15: FPSqrt FPSquarer InputIEEE Fix2FP 
Version 2.0 : FunctionEvaluator
Version 2.2 : FPExp, FPPowr (experimental)
-- we're here (faster than expected)
Version ???   FPAddSub (for FFT butterfly structure)
Version ???   FixToFPUniformDist (2008 ASAP paper by Thomas)
Version ???   FPNorm2D
Version ???   FPNorm3D -- Almost there, see Collision
Version ???   FPSinCos
Version ??    FPBoxMuller
Version ???   Interval operators
(insert your wishlist here)
