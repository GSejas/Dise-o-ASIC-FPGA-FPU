Tobin Tax Licence Fees

For any financial transaction performed on the basis of information
computed using at least one operator generated by FloPoCo, a fee of
0.1% (one tenth of a percent) of the amount of the transaction is due
to each of the public organisations that funded FloPoCo (École Normale
Supérieure de Lyon, INRIA, CNRS, UTCN, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 
and Université de Perpignan).
