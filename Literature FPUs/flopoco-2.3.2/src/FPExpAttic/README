This directory contains unmaintained code that used to compute the exponential by the recurrence described in the Arith 2007 paper "Return of the hardware floating-point elementary function"

This code was replaced with the polynomial-based version that is more suited to current FPGA's DSP and memory blocks.

All the files in this directory were written by Xavier Pujol and later FloPoCo-ized by Florent de Dinechin. They now belong to the FloPoCo project and are 
  Initial software.
