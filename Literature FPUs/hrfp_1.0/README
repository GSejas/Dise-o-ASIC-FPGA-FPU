HRFP_16 distribution version 1.0
--------------------------------

This directory contains the source code for the high radix floating
point adder and multiplier presented in the FPT2014 paper:

Andreas Ehliar, "Area efficient Floating-Point Adder and Multiplier
with IEEE-754 Compatible Semantics", The 2014 International Conference
on Field-Programmable Technology

(If you want to cite HRFP_16, the publication above is the most
suitable reference.)

The source code is not quite identical to the version presented at the
conference thoguh, as the readability of it has been improved by
removing dead code and also the addition of some clarifying comments
here and there in the source code. Even so, the source code is sadly
underdocumented at the moment. However, if you are running into some
issues with the source code, feel free to contact me at
andreas.ehliar@liu.se and I will try to solve your problem.


Overall architecture of the adder/multiplier
--------------------------------------------

The best documentation for the overall architecture is the paper
itself. If you cannot download the final version from IEEE Xplore you
can download the almost-final version of the paper from the HRFP_16
webpage at http://users.isy.liu.se/da/ehliar/hrfp/ .


Building the code
-----------------

There are some Makefile targets available in the Makefile (although
you will probably need to change the path to the Xilinx tools though).
The code has been compiled and tested using Linux, Modelsim, and
Xilinx ISE. At some point the code could also be simulated using
Icarus, although this has not been tested lately.

To see the available targets, you can simply run make help

Requirements for running the testbenches
----------------------------------------

If you want to run the testbenches you will either need to download
the FPGen testsuite from IBM at the following URL:
https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/fpgen/ieeets.html
and extract the *.fpgen files into the fpgen_testsuite directory or
download the SoftFloat distribution (which can be done automatically
by a Makefile rule.)



Known bugs
----------

* The documentation could be improved
* The maintainability of the source could be improved

If you have found a bug or have a patch for the software/hardware in
this distribution, please contact the author at andreas.ehliar@liu.se
and I will try to include it in the next version of the release.


TODO
----

* Altera/Lattice/etc version (FPGAs with 18x18 bit multipliers should
  be very well suited for the HRFP_16 format.)
* Double precision support
* Half precision support
* More rounding modes
* Area/frequency improvements
* More configurable architecture (e.g. number of pipeline steps)
* More operators (MAC support would be very nice)
* Move development to GitHub?
* Get HRFP_16 operator support into commercial FPGA silicon :)
* Enable parallelization of the exhaustive testbench as the run time
  is extremely long.

Acknowledgments
---------------

* The FPGen at IBM team for releasing the fpgen testsuite in the first
  place (which has been a huge help in minimizing verification time)
  and also by helpfully enlighten the author about exception handling
  in IEEE-754.
* Madeleine Englund for many interesting discussions regarding
  high-radix floating point arithmetic in FPGAs
