(sin((pi) / 3) - sqrt(3) / 2) * 9.99002e30102 + 3 has been converted to some number. Expecting that the above warning message states that faithtul evaluation is *NOT* possible.

Testing a tricky expression. Might return INT64_MAX with an overflow message or return anything with a message stating that faithful rounding was not possible... OK
