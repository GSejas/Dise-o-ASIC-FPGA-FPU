Substituting _x_ in _x_ + 1 + _x_^2 with 13 yields 183
Substituting _x_ in _x_ + 1 + _x_^2 with exp(_x_) yields exp(_x_) + 1 + exp(_x_)^2
Substituting _x_ in _x_ + 1 + _x_^2 with (5 * _x_ + 7) * _x_ + 9 yields 91 + _x_ * (133 + _x_ * (144 + _x_ * (70 + _x_ * 25)))
Substituting _x_ in _x_ + 1 + _x_^2 with sqrt(_x_) yields sqrt(_x_) + 1 + _x_
Substituting _x_ in _x_ + 1 + _x_^2 with 1001 yields 1003003
Substituting _x_ in log(_x_) with 13 yields log(13)
Substituting _x_ in log(_x_) with exp(_x_) yields _x_
Substituting _x_ in log(_x_) with (5 * _x_ + 7) * _x_ + 9 yields log((5 * _x_ + 7) * _x_ + 9)
Substituting _x_ in log(_x_) with sqrt(_x_) yields log(sqrt(_x_))
Substituting _x_ in log(_x_) with 1001 yields log(1001)
Substituting _x_ in 17 with 13 yields 17
Substituting _x_ in 17 with exp(_x_) yields 17
