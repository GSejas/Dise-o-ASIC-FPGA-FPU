Sollya is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
it offers a certified infinity norm, an automatic polynomial
implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.


In order to compile the software you will need the following packages
installed:

- gcc
- g++
- gnuplot
- gmp
- mpfr
- mpfi
- libxml2-dev
- fplll (available at url http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/damien.stehle/english.html#software)
- libtool

In order to compile, use the makefile by invoking it using the
following command:

./configure
make

The configure script coming with this distribution of Sollya supports
several --with-*** switches. These switches, as usual, enable the libraries
Sollya depends on to be installed in non-standard directories.
Please use

./configure --help

to get an overview over the different switches.


You can finally use the software typing

./sollya

or install it with:

make install

The use of the readline-wrapper rlwrap is highly recommended for
interactive work with sollya.


If you wish to compile and install Sollya from a fresh svn checkout,
you further need:

- bison version 2.3 or later
- flex version 2.5.33 or later

Bison and flex are really needed if you compile a fresh svn checkout
or if you modify the grammar files contained in the
distribution. Otherwise, precompiled versions are found in the
distribution and can be used.

When compiling a fresh svn checkout, launch first the autogen.sh shell
script before executing the two steps indicated above.
Users compiling fresh svn checkouts are recommanded to use the
--enable-strict-lexer-parser-check option of the configure script.
