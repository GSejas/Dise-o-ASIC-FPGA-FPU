Warning: a coefficient is not at least 2 times greater than a already evaluated sub-polynomial.
This procedure is not able to implement the polynomial correctly in this case.
Warning: the infered precision of the 13th coefficient of the polynomial is greater than
the necessary precision computed for this step. This may make the automatic determination
of precisions useless.
Warning: a problem has been encountered during the determination of the precisions needed.
The produced implementation may be incorrect.
Polynomial implemented as given.
