	* remez.c: * Patched bug #16632 [Infinite loop in dirtyfindzeros]
	  Also, there was a bug in the estimation of the precision of a
	  root computed by Newton's algorithm.
	  As a result, I think that the algorithm could have oscillate
	  between some value and its successor in the
	  given floating-point format, without an end.
	  I hope that this revision also solves this issue, but I am not
	  able to artificially produce such an example of oscillation, so I
	  cannot check that my patch corrects this issue.

2013-11-13 16:05  schevill

	* configure.ac: * Second attempt.
	  The problem that we try to fix here is that adding -lstdc++ in
	  the compilation line does not work when gcc is used to link and
	  when gcc version does not agreee with g++ version.
	  Also, it might not work if the version of g++ does not agree with
	  the version of lstdc++.
	  
	  We add -lstdc++ to the compilation line only if we are sure that
	  it works. Not adding it does no harm in general, as it is only
	  needed on Cygwin, with old versions of fplll.
	  Hopefully (but it is hard to test it in order to be certain), if
	  we are in the unlikely case when:
	  1) we have an old version of fplll
	  2) we are on Cygwin
	  3) we cannot add -lstdc++ to the compilation line,
	  configure will detect that sollya cannot be build on this
	  specific machine. What makes me optimistic about it is the fact
	  that there is a test after all this mess that tries to compile
	  and run a small example program using fplll. I think that that
	  test will fail on this particular architecture.

2013-10-11 13:57  schevill

	* tests-tool/check027.sollya, tests-tool/check027.sollya.reference:
	  * Non-regression tests for bugs #13046 and #16434.
	  Bug #16434 is not completely fixed though, because it still
	  requires to take a decision about what Sollya should return when
	  asked for evaluating a/b with a and b mathematically equal to 0.
	  Currently, we return [-Inf, Inf] (this is the behavior considered
	  as correct in the newly added tests in check027.sollya, for
	  instance). We have always considered that [-Inf, Inf] and NaN
	  were approximately as useless, so we did not think too much about
	  when we should return one or another.
	  However, for instance sin([-Inf, Inf]) can legitimately return
	  [-1, 1], while sin([NaN, NaN]) must return NaN. One means 'some
	  arbitrary value in the range of sin' while the other means 'some
	  computation was incorrect'.
	  
	  We do not change this behavior now, but we might think of this
	  problem and change the behavior for a future release.

2013-10-10 13:01  schevill

	* remez.c: * Patched a nasty bug in Newton: whenever the iterator
	  of Newton's algorithm evaluates to NaN, the next point of the
	  algorithm used to be NaN leading to an infinite loop.
	  This bug is here for a very long time, but seems to have been
	  undiscovered until now, because it is barely impossible to
	  produce.
	  We incidentally discovered it two revisions ago, because of deep
	  modifications that we made in the code used to simplify
	  expressions.
	  The problem has been detected by check012 which felt into an
	  infinite loop.
	  These modifications have been further improved at previous
	  revision, hiding again the bug in Newton.
	  I am unfortunately not able to produce a non-regression test in
	  the current state of the repository.

	* tests-tool/Makefile.am, tests-tool/check024.sollya,
	  tests-tool/check024.sollya.reference: * Non-regression test for
	  bug #15927

2013-06-21 16:24  schevill

	* configure.ac: * Removed too much at previous revision.

2013-06-21 15:12  schevill

	* configure.ac: * Removing some code in configure.ac that neither
	  Christoph nor me understands.
	  This code was probably designed to prevent some possible trouble
	  on Cygwin but it seems incomplete and we cannot
	  complete it without fully understanding what circumstances it is
	  intended to catch.

2013-06-21 14:43  schevill

	* configure.ac: * Improved configure.ac, in particular with a more
	  systematic test suite for FPLLL.

2013-06-20 15:27  clauter

	* configure.ac: Trying to patch the FPLLL build bug on Ubuntu.

2013-06-18 14:16  clauter

	  character.

2013-06-10 13:22  schevill

	* tests-tool/check001.sollya.reference: * The behavior of degree on
	  '0/x' is actually expected to be -1, since we cannot simplify
	  expressions of the form 0/something and degree of an expression
	  that is not a polynomial is expected to be -1.

2013-06-10 12:32  schevill

	* tests-tool/check001.sollya, tests-tool/check001.sollya.reference:
	  * Non-regression tests for bug #15858 patched at revision 2102.
	  Yet, the current behavior of degree on 0/x does not seems normal
	  to me.
	  Consequently, the just added non-regression test fails currently.

2013-06-10 11:18  clauter

	* execute.c, expression.c, expression.h: Patched a bug in
	  hornerization, division by a power of x and computation of the
	  degree of a polynomial. The patch required adding some
	  optimization to the code extracting the i-th coefficient of a
	  polynomial expression.

2013-06-03 12:12  clauter

	* library.c, sollya-messages.h, sollya-messaging.h: Added support
	  for an optional destructor function in an external library.

	  because it is not part of the documentation.

2013-05-29 16:24  schevill

	* README, configure.ac: * configure.ac more readable and simpler.
	  Should patch a bug observed with configure observed on machines
	  that do not have mpfi installed.
	  Amongst other, the test for dladdr used to systematically think
	  that dladdr was not present, as soon as mpfi was not present.

2013-05-29 13:57  clauter

	* configure.ac, library.c: Made dladdr use more portable.

2013-05-28 14:07  schevill

	* doc/sollya.pdf, doc/sollya.tex: * Restored previous formatting of

2012-12-07 13:41  clauter

	* configure.ac, expression.h: Added

2012-11-22 22:12  schevill

	* external.c, plot.c: Reverted change of the previous revision.
	  The patch *is* a bug. Indeed, correcting it is easy: it suffices
	  to change
	  "%" into "%%". Moreover, "%g" would sound more appropriate to me
	  than "%e"
	  and would be conform to the behavior on the setting by default in
	  my version
	  of gnuplot.
	  @Christoph: can you explain the nature of the "displaying error"
	  that you
	  mention? Would "%g" make bug recent versions of gnuplot?

2012-11-22 17:41  clauter

	  Finished work on the sollya_lib_build_function... functions for
	  library functions and constants and procedure functions. Added
	  also versions that do not consume their sollya_obj_t argument(s).
	  Moved all occurrences of calls to free() to safeFree(). Modified
	  #include structure for Chebyshev Model code.

2012-05-23 11:16  schevill

	* tests-lib/tdirtyinfnorm.c, tests-lib/tdirtyinfnorm.reference: *
	  Patched a bug in the test of dirtyinfnorm. Since dirtyinfnorm
	  perturbs the sampling points (as do remez and plot) it is
	  affected by the old bug of mpfr_urandomb
	  and it becomes apparent on one of the tests. I apply the same
	  methodology as with remez: I test if one of the three expected
	  behaviors appears or not.

2012-05-23 11:02  clauter

	* configure.ac, execute.c, execute.h, library.c,
	  sollya-library-wrappers.c: Some progress with sollya_lib_build
	  for library functions and constants.

2012-05-22 15:28  schevill

	* mpfi-compat.c: * Patched a bug that has been detected because
	  check021 failed.
	  The bug actually lies inside MPFI 1.5 and has been corrected in
	  the most recent versions of MPFI.
	  However, since MPFI 1.5 is still widely distributed (e.g., by
	  Debian), it seems appropriate to
	  patch the behavior directly in mpfi-compat.c instead of relying
	  on the patch of MPFI.
	  In consequence, we do not use mpfi_sub_fr anymore but reimplement
	  it by ourself. As a consequence,
	  we might (very marginally) loose performance.

2012-05-21 15:50  clauter

	* parser.y, sollya-library-wrappers.c, sollya.h: Some progress with
	  extending the sollya_lib_build_... functions.

	* doc/chebyshevform.tex, doc/sollya.pdf, doc/sollya.tex,
	  doc/www/ListOfCommands.php, doc/www/chebyshevform.php, help.h: *
	  Suppressed the remark about the fact that one should uninstall a
	  callback before installing another one
	  (in the future, if some day uninstalling a callback is really
	  needed before installing a new one, in order
	  to avoid memory leaks, then we would have to do it ourself by
	  implementing the call to uninstall inside
	  the function install).
	  
	  * Added missing generated help files for chebyshevform to the
	  repository.

2012-05-03 12:29  schevill

	* sollya-messages.h, sollya-messaging.h, tests-tool/Makefile.am,
	  tests-tool/check021.sollya, tests-tool/check021.sollya.reference:
	  * Updated sollya-messag*.h from branches/experimentalChebModels.
	  For some cosmic reason,
	  they had not been updated when I performed the svn merge at
	  previous revision.
	  
	  * Added check021.sollya.* and updated Makefile.am in directory
	  tests-lib. Mioara used to
	  put them in the old 'tests' directory that does not exist
	  anymore. As a consequence : the
	  tests do not pass currently, because of check021.sollya. I
	  suspect that Mioara always thought
	  that her tests passed because her 'make check' was indeed not
	  using her files.

	  function that were no longer in use.
	  
	  Changed the behavior of evaluateFaithful, making quite a few

	  The new evaluateFaithful returns the correct rounding to the
	  nearest
	  as a faithful rounding wherever possible (if the proof interval
	  is
	  sufficiently small) and returns the correct rounding to the
	  nearest
	  (ties to even) of the midpoint of both possible answers
	  otherwise.
	  
	  This change in behavior should remove any biais on the rounding
	  direction
	  of faithful evaluations.
	  
	  If this change in behavior does not satisfy the users (and test
	  suite), it
	  may be reverted back in the future.

	* doc/sollya.pdf, doc/sollya.tex: * Yet another step towards a
	  complete documentation of the library.

2012-03-07 14:50  clauter

	* general.h, sollya-library-wrappers.c, sollya.h: Added the
	  functions sollya_lib_malloc, sollya_lib_calloc and
	  sollya_lib_realloc to the Sollya library.

2012-03-06 14:01  clauter

	* sollya-library-wrappers.c, sollya.h: Added a new function to the
	  Sollya library: int sollya_lib_get_prec_of_range(mp_prec_t *,
	  sollya_obj_t);

2012-03-05 16:31  clauter

	* sollya-library-wrappers.c: Corrected a mistake due to a change in
	  behavior in sollya_lib_get_constant.

2012-03-05 12:17  clauter

	* sollya-library-wrappers.c, sollya.h, tests-lib/Makefile.am,

	  tests-lib/tassign_in_structure.reference,
	  tests-lib/tcreate_structure.c,
	  tests-lib/tcreate_structure.reference: Changed name of the
	  library function allowing elements to be assigned in structures:
	  the name now is sollya_lib_create_structure.

2012-03-05 12:08  clauter

	* sollya.h: Corrected a mistake in a comment in sollya.h

2012-03-05 10:25  schevill

	* tests-lib/Makefile.am, tests-tool/Makefile.am: * Patched a bug
	  appearing when trying to perform make dist (tries to compile
	  force_compilation from
	  an unexisting force_compilation.c).

2012-03-02 17:01  schevill

	* doc/sollya.pdf, doc/sollya.tex: * Prototype of doc for the
	  library. It is still work in progress.

2012-03-02 09:12  clauter

	* tests-lib/Makefile.am, tests-lib/tsimplify.c,

2012-03-01 13:34  schevill

	* double.c, tests-lib/trationalapprox.reference,
	  tests-tool/check009.sollya.reference: * Improved rationalapprox
	  by returning a smaller fraction whenever possible.

2012-03-01 10:47  schevill

	* tests-tool/check001.sollya, tests-tool/check001.sollya.reference,
	  tests-tool/check009.sollya, tests-tool/check009.sollya.reference:

	  couple of tests.

2012-03-01 09:36  schevill

	* sollya-messages.h, tests-lib/trationalapprox.c: * Changed
	  SOLLYA_MSG_RATIONALAPPROX_SECOND_ARG_MUST_BE_GREATER_THAN_TWO
	  into
	  SOLLYA_MSG_RATIONALAPPROX_SECOND_ARG_MUST_BE_GREATER_THAN_ONE.

2012-03-01 09:34  schevill

	* tests-lib/trationalapprox.c, tests-lib/trationalapprox.reference:
	  * Added non-regression test for the bug patched in the previous
	  revision, and updated the reference file according to the new
	  behavior of rationalapprox after previous revision.

2012-02-29 18:04  schevill

	* double.c: * Corrected a bug that occurred in rationalapprox when
	  the target precision was small. Actually, the target precision
	  was used as working precision, which lead to undesired loss of
	  accuracy in the computations, particularly visible for
	  small precisions.

2012-02-29 17:09  schevill

	* double.c, execute.c, sollya-messages.h, sollya-messaging.h: *
	  Added an error message for the case when rationapprox is called
	  with a precision <= 1.

2012-02-29 16:32  clauter

	* expression.c, tests-lib/tdiff.reference: Unified the behavior of
	  diff for acos, asin, tan and tanh. Updated the tests for the
	  library; the ones for the tool have not been updated, yet.

2012-02-29 16:12  clauter

	* tests-lib/trationalapprox.c, tests-lib/trationalapprox.reference:
	  Updated the tests for sollya_lib_rationalapprox.

2012-02-29 15:09  schevill

	* double.c, double.h, execute.c: * Corrected bug #13943
	  Rationalapprox with low approximation accuracy makes MPFR
	  assertion fail, killing the tool's execution.
	  * Changed a bit the internal algorithm of rationalapprox in order
	  to really (yet heuristically) ensure that the result has the
	  required accuracy
	  * Reintroduced warning messages in remez and fpminimax when
	  constant expressions are given instead of constants (the warnings
	  disappeared by mistake at revision 1438).

2012-02-29 13:36  clauter

	* tests-lib/Makefile.am, tests-lib/trationalapprox.c,
	  tests-lib/trationalapprox.reference: Added tests for

	  Patched bug "[#13930] Sollya crashes unexpectedly with message
	  Error: getMaxPowerDividerUnsafe: an error occurred. The exponent
	  in a power operator is not constant." and added a regression test
	  for it.

2012-02-17 15:48  schevill

	* tests/check001.sollya, tests/check001.sollya.reference: * Added

2012-01-09 11:04  clauter

	* execute.c: Changed a warning message in order to patch bug #10317

2011-11-14 17:16  schevill

	* sollya.h: * Added forgotten declaration @rev 1370 in sollya.h.
	  guessDegree now takes an integer argument 'bound' which is a
	  stopping criterion for the algorithm.
	  In Sollya, the default value is 1024. In practice, the algorithm
	  aborts if it does not achieve to prove that
	  the degree you are looking for is smaller than bound.

	* Makefile.am, autodiff.c, double.c, execute.c, expression.c,

	  all printMessages to have a new numeric argument that indicates a
	  message number. This argument is taken but not yet used.

2011-11-02 10:59  clauter

	* execute.c: Wrapped parseString to handle cases when a syntax
	  error occurs

2011-11-02 10:47  clauter

	* remez.c: Finished converting everything to printMessage using the
	  new format specifiers

2011-10-28 09:51  clauter

	* external.c, implement.c, infnorm.c, mpfi-compat.c, mpfi-compat.h,
	  plot.c, printf.c, remez.c, sturm.c, worstcase.c: Changed the
	  argument type for the new Sollya printf format specifiers: %v now
	  takes an mpfr_t directly (not a pointer to an mpfr_t), %w takes a
	  sollya_mpfi_t, %r takes a mpq_t. However, %b still takes a node
	  *. Converted all the code to these new (cleaner) types.

2011-10-28 08:34  clauter

	* printf.c, remez.c: Continued working on extended Sollya printf
	  with format specifiers for MPFR, MPFI and node* types

2011-10-26 12:20  clauter

	* printf.c, sturm.c, sturm.h: Added format specifier %r for mpq
	  values to sollyaPrintf and converted sturm.c to printMessage,
	  using that new format specifier

2011-10-26 11:59  clauter

	* execute.c, expression.c, external.c, implement.c, infnorm.c,
	  lexer.l, plot.c, remez.c, worstcase.c: Started converting all
	  occurrences of "if (verbosity >= foo) { changeMode();
	  sollyaPrintf(...) ... }" to printMessages, using the new %v, %w
	  and %b format specifiers. Files remez.c and sturm.c still need to
	  be converted: for sturm.c, we need a format specifier for GMP
	  rationals, for remez.c, we need support for a precision modifier
	  that works with %v.

2011-10-26 09:15  clauter

	* Makefile.am, general.c, infnorm.c, infnorm.h, printf.c, printf.h:
	  Started working on a sollyaPrintf that supports format specifiers
	  for MPFR, MPFI values and Sollya node trees.

2011-10-20 13:27  clauter

	* general.c: Corrected a long lasting bug in printMessage occuring
	  with the use of va_start. This might be in relation with the
	  "Contact with Houston lost"-phenomenon

2011-09-05 09:32  schevill

	* tests/check010.sollya.reference: * Update of
	  check010.sollya.reference because Sollya now prints a message
	  when rename(something,y) is used while the free variable does not
	  yet have
	  a name.

	  tests/memoryleaks.sollya: * Change in remez and fpminimax
	  commands syntax: the second argument can now
	  be any list of functions, and allows the user to compute
	  approximation in
	  any basis.
	  
	  * IMPORTANT NOTE: the signature of the internal functions remez
	  and remezAux
	  changed. This might affect users of the library. The signature of
	  the
	  internal functions FPminimax and FPminimaxMain did not change;
	  however
	  the meaning of the chain *monomials argument changed: it used to
	  be a
	  list of integers and is now a list of pure trees.
	  
	  * remez now returns a non-hornerized polynomial. However, it is
	  not hard to
	  maintain compatibility with the old behavior, if needed.
	  
	  * memoryleaks checks have been added, and the new
	  functionnalities are
	  documented. However, no test case has been added yet.

2011-08-24 15:55  schevill

	* tests/check020.sollya, tests/check020.sollya.reference: * This

2011-08-06 22:03  schevill

	* tests/check012.sollya.reference: * One of the fpminimax instances
	  seems to give different results on 32 bit
	  and 64 bits computers, due to a difference of the behavior of
	  FPLLL. This must
	  still be confirmed. Meanwhile, I reset the reference with the
	  previous value,

	  As a consequence polynomials computed by remez algorithm were
	  different with recent versions
	  of MPFR compared to older versions and the tests were broken.
	  
	  The set of tests should now pass both with old and recent MPFR
	  libraries.
	  
	  A problem might still remain with check012 (it is FPminimax). I
	  have to investigate if it is

	* execute.c: Made faithful floating-point evaluation at the prompt
	  and for := and ~ recognize cases where a function is applied to a
	  constant and evaluate that function at that point instead of
	  evaluating the constant tree obtained by substituting the
	  constant into the tree at some arbitrary point. This resolves an

	  some point but that involve procedure-base functions for which
	  the tool cannot perform meaningful simplifications.

2011-07-21 10:54  clauter

	* execute.c, expression.c: Patched a bug in error-free

2011-06-22 15:52  schevill

	* execute.c: * Patched a bug with the optional sixth argument of
	  remez: now it ensures that it is non-negative.

2011-06-22 15:48  schevill

	* execute.c, fpminimax.cpp, remez.c, remez.h: * Added a sixth
	  optional parameter to remez command. This parameter is currently
	  *DEPRECATED* because we do not guarantee to
	  support it in the future. The behavior of this sixth parameter
	  may change without any warning in the future.
	  
	  Currently the sixth parameter is an interval [satisfying_err,
	  target_err] with the following behavior:
	  - if, during the algorithm, we manage to prove that target_err is
	  unreachable, we stop the algorithm returning the last computed
	  polynomial.
	  - if, during the algorithm, we obtain a polynomial with an error
	  smaller than satisfying_err, we stop the algorithm returning that
	  polynomial.
	  - otherwise we loop until we find an optimal polynomial with the
	  required quality, as usual.
	  
	  The default is [0, +Inf] ('default' keyword is supported).
	  
	  Examples of use:
	  [0, +Inf] -> whatever happens, compute the optimal polynomial
	  with the required quality (same behavior as before).
	  [target_err] -> my target error is target_err. If you manage to
	  prove that it is not reachable stop computing immediately
	  (I do not care the optimal polynomial: it is worst than what I
	  need anyway). On the contrary, if you manage
	  to find a polynomial with that error, do not continue further
	  (that one is sufficient for my needs).
	  [0, target_err] -> I am interested by the optimal polynomial,
	  except if it is not even able to provide me target_err
	  (typically: I absolutely need an error smaller than target_err,
	  but any extra bit of accuracy would be welcome, so I am
	  interested by the optimal polynomial nonetheless)
	  [satisfying_err, +Inf] -> I am happy with any polynomial with an
	  error better than satisfying_error (so, stop the computation
	  as soon as such a polynomial is found). However, if such a
	  polynomial does not exist, I would like to use the optimal
	  polynomial (typically: I have the constraint that I cannot use a
	  degree larger than a given n. Under this constraint,
	  I would like to achieve satisfying_error, or if not possible,
	  keep my constraint but get the best possible approximation)
	  [target_err/4, target_err] -> My target error is target_err, so I
	  would like to immediately stop the computation if it is not
	  achievable. Moreover, I need some room (maybe because I will use
	  my remez polynomial as the input of fpminimax, and this
	  will make me loose accuracy). So, 2 extra bits are enough (do not
	  compute further if you already have the two extra bits),
	  and if this goal is not achievable, give me the closest to my 2
	  extra bits (i.e. the optimal polynomial).

	* doc/help.php, doc/infnorm.shlp, doc/shlp2html.sh, doc/sollya.php:
	  * Removed warning errors signaled by the W3C validator.
	  Some of them were minor, other were more important. Here is a
	  summary.
	  
	  * In sollya.php: some </li> without <li>. They came from the fact
	  that large
	  parts of sollya.php have been auto-generated from sollya.tex and
	  not
	  carefully re-read.
	  
	  * In sollya.php: missing <p> at some places.
	  
	  * In sollya.php: links in php were of the form
	  help.php?field1=foo&field2=bar
	  instead of help.php?field1=foo&amp;field2=bar.
	  I was just not aware of this subtility.
	  
	  * In the html code produced by shlp2html: there remained many '<'
	  and '>'
	  that should normally have been protected as &lt; and &gt;
	  This was a fairly big issue in my opinion, and I am even
	  surprised that the
	  HTML has been correctly rendered by Iceweasel.
	  Correcting this made me modify things in shlp2html.sh. Hope I did
	  not break
	  anything (I checked and it seems not, but I can have missed
	  something).
	  
	  * Corrected a typo in the way infnorm.shlp was formatted, that
	  prevented
	  shlp2html.sh to correctly generate items.

2011-02-01 16:08  schevill

	* tests/check.sollya, tests/check.sollya.output,
	  tests/checkSupnorm.sollya: * Due to a bug in MPFR, mpfr_urandom
	  used to give different results on 32-bit and 64-bit computers.
	  Since remez perturbs the initial points in order to avoid
	  undesirable regularity effects, this bug has an influence
	  on the result of the remez command. The result is fine in any
	  case, but not bit-per-bit the same on all computers.
	  This was detected by make check. As a matter of fact, we do not
	  claim to have totally reproductible results on
	  every platform; we only claim to give correct results (i.e. with
	  an error bounded by what the user has asked for).
	  However, the reproductibility is desirable, e.g. because it eases
	  debugging. Hence, we find desirable that make check
	  detects whenever Sollya has a platform-dependent behavior.
	  
	  In this revision, I patched check.sollya in order to make it
	  pass, despite the bug. But I also added a test that
	  checks that we have one of the three expected behavior: either
	  with a 32-bit architecture with an old MPFR, or with a
	  64-bit architecture with an old MPFR, or any architecture with a
	  recent version (i.e. today, a SVN one) of MPFR.

2011-01-28 15:48  schevill

	* autodiff.c, infnorm.c, mpfi-compat.c, mpfi-compat.h, sturm.c: *
	  Removed occurrences of sollya_mpfi_is_pos.
	  The only problematic ones were in sturm.c: indeed, in the current
	  implementation, the case when we have an exact zero
	  (point-interval) is ignored for counting the chanes of sign, and
	  the case when 0 is a bound leads to an error (result=1 returned
	  by the function).

2011-01-24 14:04  schevill

	* mpfi-compat.c, tests/check.sollya, tests/check.sollya.output: *

	  (used to return [-@Inf@, @Inf@] instead of [0, @Inf@])
	  
	  * I discovered that I introduced a bug when I worked on

	  behavior:
	  it was returning true when at least one of the bounds was zero. I
	  patched this bug and introduced new checks in order to avoid a
	  regression on this subject (previously, make check was not able
	  to discover the bug).

	  Developers: please remember that we have to use sollya_mpfi_* now
	  instead of mpfi_*.

2010-10-13 14:24  clauter

	* configure.ac, general.c, parser.y, tests/timecheck.sollya: Added
	  MPFR, GMP and MPFI version printing to version and --help and
	  changed timecheck again to lower the variance everywhere unless
	  necessary

2010-10-13 11:56  clauter

	* tests/timecheck.sollya, tests/timecheck.sollya.output: Reworked a

	  warning message printing: --warnonstderr
	  prints all warnings on stderr instead of stdout, --warninfile and
	  --warninfileappend print all warnings in a file (or a named
	  pipe).
	  
	  For the developer the change means that printf and fprintf must
	  no
	  longer be used in the code. The functions sollyaPrintf and
	  sollyaFprintf, which behave exactly the same, must be used
	  instead.

2010-08-21 19:26  clauter

	* tests/check.sollya.output: New test output reflecting the recent

2010-08-21 04:15  clauter

	  expression.c, expression.h, infnorm.c, internparser.y,
	  miniparser.y, parser.y, proof.c, proof.h, taylorform.c, xml.c:
	  Started adding procedure-based functions with a technique similar
	  to
	  library functions. There is still a bug in the displaying of
	  differentiated procedure-based functions (as well as for library
	  functions - we just never saw it).

2010-08-18 14:21  schevill

	* tests/checkTMandAD.sollya: Added labels for the tests in
	  checkTMandAD.sollya

2010-08-17 20:04  clauter

	* execute.c: Corrected a small mistake in the code analysing the
	  correctness of the
	  arguments to fpminimax.

2010-08-16 11:41  schevill

	* taylorform.c, tests/check.sollya, tests/timecheck.sollya,
	  tests/timecheck.sollya.output: Reverted change of revision 1079
	  in taylorform.c since Christoph corrected
	  the bug #10657.
	  
	  Added a test case.

2010-08-12 18:18  clauter

	* execute.c, infnorm.c, infnorm.h: Added optimisation for equality
	  and inequality tests when simple interval evaluation without
	  precision adjustments already allows the result to be decided
	  upon.

2010-08-12 16:44  clauter

	* execute.c: Added minimum/maximum computation on lists

2010-08-12 16:26  clauter

2010-07-24 00:03  clauter

	* execute.c, execute.h, expression.c, expression.h: Tried to
	  address the bug "[#10657] Shifting a polynomial in Horner
	  form consumes all the memory"
	  
	  The code runs through the test and seems to be much faster but a
	  lot of optimisations are still possible. Some algorithms are
	  really
	  naive (but much less naive than what we had).

2010-06-30 13:23  schevill

	* taylorform.c: Reverted a bug introduced in revision 1008.
	  Indeed, makePolynomial seems to create a polynomial expression p
	  such that
	  p(x-x0) is very long to evalute with Sollya, while constructPoly
	  perfectly
	  does the trick.

2010-05-21 20:59  clauter

	* infnorm.c: Slight enhancement to interval evaluation

2010-05-20 13:46  clauter

	* execute.c, execute.h, internparser.y, miniparser.y, parser.y:
	  Enabled parsing of long lists by reversing the recursion in the
	  parser

	  > f = sin(x * 2 * pi * points) + 3;
	  > dirtyinfnorm(f,[1;2]);
	  3.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000167935
	  
	  (example proposed by Christoph).
	  I applied the same randomization strategy to dirtyinfnorm as
	  well.

2009-10-02 14:39  schevill

	* infnorm.c: Patched dirtyinfnorm in order to take rigorously into

	  f = log(x)/log(2) - log10(x)/log10(2) + 3
	  where the function is constant but f' cannot be proven to be 0.

2009-10-02 11:33  schevill

	* infnorm.c: Reverted a modification by Christoph which introduced
	  a possible bug when computing ||f|| where f is almost constant.
	  This a is a short-term patch, while we are thinkning of a way of
	  dealing with examples such as:
	  
	  f = log(x)/log(2) - log10(x)/log10(2) + 3;
	  dirtyinfnorm(f,[1;2]);
	  
	  I also corrected a small mistake: there is no need to run
	  Newton's algorithm where either f'(x1) or f'(x3)=0 since it means
	  that either x1 or x3 is the local extremum. These points are tken
	  into account anyway.

2009-10-01 15:11  schevill

	* infnorm.c, remez.c, tests/check.sollya,
	  tests/check.sollya.output: * This is an attempt to patch bug
	  #8330 about the accuracy of dirtyinfnorm.
	  I propose a new implementation of uncertifiedInfnorm. This
	  implementation does mainly
	  the same as before but avoid evaluating the derivative of f as
	  much as possible.
	  It uses evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast and my implementation of
	  Newton's algorithm.
	  
	  * I made some modifications to evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast:
	  startprec is now really used
	  as the initial precision. This code should be read carefully by
	  someone else than me since it
	  is a critical code for Sollya. However, the tests of check.sollya
	  all pass.
	  
	  * I modified check.sollya: I corrected some syntax errors and
	  added a test case for the byg #8330.

2009-10-01 02:21  clauter

	* execute.c, execute.h, internlexer.l, internparser.y, lexer.l,
	  minilexer.l, miniparser.y, parser.y: Added high-level time
	  command

2009-09-25 10:12  schevill

	* infnorm.c, remez.c, tests/check.sollya,
	  tests/check.sollya.output: * Patched Newton's algorithm: except
	  if there is a bug in the patch, the algorithm should be more
	  stable now.
	  In particular, there was a bug when searching for the zero of f
	  in [a,b] where a<0<b and f(0) = NaN. This bug is now solved.
	  This bug had been introduced in revision 783 and was observed for
	  instance when calling remez((2^x-1)/x,9,[-1/16,1/16])
	  that had become very slow due to the bug.
	  Christoph also observed the bug when trying to improve
	  dirtyinform.
	  
	  * I added a new possible returned value to
	  evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast. In fact, I used to believe that 0
	  was returned if
	  and only if the algorithm was unable to find a precision
	  guaranteeing the faithful rounding. It appears that 0 was also
	  returned
	  when the algorithm does not manage to evaluate the expression
	  into a real number (e.g. it evaluates to Inf or NaN).
	  Now, evaluateFaithfulWithcutOffFast returns 3 in this case. This
	  allows one to see the difference between a problem of accuracy
	  (i.e. f(x) is too small) and a problem of evaluation (i.e. f(x)
	  is not defined or has a false singularity that cannot be
	  detected).
	  I modified every functions that use the returned value of
	  evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast, in order to keep the
	  compatibility.
	  
	  * I added a test case for remez((2^x-1)/x,9,[-1/16,1/16]) in
	  check.sollya
	  I also numbered the test cases because it was really a mess to
	  find out where a problem came from when somthing changed
	  in check.sollya.output.
	  I also discovered some bugs in check.sollya (syntax errors) that
	  I corrected.
	  Finally, the test case number 171 invoked 'quit' which prevented
	  to run the following tests. I guess it was a mistake, so
	  I commented it. If it was intended, please uncomment it, but put
	  this test case as the last one.

	* double.c, execute.c, expression.c, general.c, tests/check.sollya,
	  tests/check.sollya.output: (1)
	  
	  Corrected a bug in reproducibility of the displaying of values:
	  
	  For precisions prec set between 32 and 64, integer values between
	  2^31
	  and 2^63-1 were displayed differently on machines for which
	  sizeof(int) = 8 than for those for which sizeof(int) = 16.
	  
	  (2)
	  
	  Degraded 4 warnings on D, DD, TD, DE
	  
	  "Warning: rounding a value computed on less than 53 bits to
	  double
	  precision."
	  
	  to an information.
	  
	  (3)
	  
	  Changed the behaviour of the tool on automatic printing (on the
	  prompt) if no faithful rounding can be determined for a constant
	  expression.
	  
	  For constant expressions f(c) for which it can be proved that it
	  exists two reals (not including infinity) a and b such that
	  
	  a <= f(c) <= b
	  
	  and a * b < 0, 0 is displayed instead of some FP-determined value
	  if
	  no faithful rounding for f(c) can be determined.
	  
	  The warning texts have significantly been changed, hence an
	  update of
	  the check files.
	  
	  The change might involve issue with backward compatibility.
	  
	  ATTENTION:
	  
	  The help text and documentation files have not been updated yet.
	  
	  THIS MUST BE DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
	  
	  
	  (4)

	* double.c, tests/check.sollya, tests/check.sollya.output: Second
	  and hopefully final version of the patch for bug
	  #7085 Rounding to simplie value with infinity overflow is wrong.
	  
	  The bug (and several bugs hidden by the bug [un bogue peut en
	  cacher
	  un autre]) was due to double rounding issues. The double
	  roundings
	  either occurred because of:
	  
	  - a first rounding to double precision or
	  
	  - a rounding to 24 bits with unbounded exponent range or
	  
	  - a rounding to 24 bits with unbounded exponent range followed by
	  a
	  rounding to double precision followed by a rounding to single
	  precision.
	  
	  Everthing's should be fine now.

2009-02-23 21:00  clauter

	* double.c: First version of patch for bug #7085 Rounding to simple

	* fpminimax.cpp: Bug of infinite loop (see bug report #7217)
	  temporarily patched. If fpminimax has too many loops it fails.

2009-01-21 13:51  schevill

	* README, fpminimax.cpp: Fpminimax exhibitted an infinite loop in a
	  particular case.
	  When the coefficients are floating-point numbers, the algorithm
	  has to guess the exponents of the coefficients first.
	  Then, fpminimax is launched and we check afterwards that the
	  coefficients have the same exponent as we guessed.
	  If it is not the case, we correct the exponents and loop.
	  
	  I knew that it could lead theoretically to an infinite loop. Yet,
	  it was never oberved in practice.
	  Mioara found the following instance that effectively leads to an
	  infinite loop:
	  f=sqrt(x); d=[1+12/512, 1+13/512]; fpminimax(f, 2, [|18, 10,
	  14|], d);
	  
	  It turns out that the algorithm loops over the two polynomials
	  p=-1.00100001000101_2 * 2^(-3) * x^2 + 1.10010001_2 * 2^(-1) * x
	  + 1.0110111010000111_2 * 2^(-2)
	  q=-1.100110000101_2 * 2^(-4) * x^2 + 1.011001011_2 * 2^(-1) * x +
	  1.10011011000101111_2 * 2^(-2)
	  
	  Surprinsingly, the coefficients of x^2 is not the same at all in
	  both polynomials.
	  
	  I patched the algorithm with the following trick: when more than
	  MAXLOOP trials have been performed, we stop as soon as a
	  polynomial fits in the formats.
	  This still ensures that the result of the algorithm has the good
	  form. This avoids the previous infinite loop but the theoretical
	  possibility of an infinite loop stays.

	* internparser.y, parser.y: I forgot to suppress references to
	  pari.h in these internparser.y and parser.y

2008-07-25 18:10  schevill

	* autodiff.c: Implementation of base_diffs for sin, cos, sinh,
	  cosh, log, log2, log10, exp and sqrt.

2008-07-25 17:31  schevill

	* autodiff.c: Implementation of exp. Note that I rewrote the base
	  case for x^p : p may be any value (not only integer) and the
	  results should be more accurate when the input interval is large.

2008-07-25 17:23  schevill

	* autodiff.c: First implementation of the multiplication.

2008-07-25 14:34  schevill

	  Mouilleron

2008-07-24 14:16  schevill

	* sollya.h: update of sollya.h in order to allow more possibilities

	* infnorm.c: Patched color handling on a warning message in infnorm

2008-07-03 10:00  schevill

	* remez.c: Christoph introduced a bug in the printing of the line
	  "A slower algorithm is used for this step (pseudo-alternating
	  condition changed)" when he introduced the coloring. It is
	  corrected.

2008-06-27 16:28  schevill

	* remez.c: Avoid infinite looping when reaching the maximum allowed
	  iterations of the algorithm

	* expression.c, expression.h: Improved precision management on
	  constants

2008-06-24 10:07  schevill

	* remez.c: When there is too many oscillations, the algorithm
	  should use the exchange algorithm. In the particular case when
	  the algorithm did not use the slower algorithm, this error was
	  caught at the end by a call to dirtyinfnorm but nothing was done
	  to solve the problem. Now, the main loop is relaunched forcing an
	  exchange step. Hopefully, this will introduce the maximum and
	  converge. The convergence should not be taken for sure.

2008-06-18 08:59  schevill

	* remez.c: A quality less than ~ 2^(-53) used to lead to an error.
	  However, the polynomial was correctly computed: it was a bug
	  affecting the final test. It is now corrected

2008-06-17 14:17  schevill

	* double.c, execute.c, expression.c, expression.h, external.c,

	* expression.c: Corrected frenglish "Remplacing" expression.

2008-05-12 16:17  schevill

	  called with only one monomial.
	  

2008-04-29 13:23  schevill

	* remez.c: patched a big bug with the random perturbation

2008-04-29 13:09  schevill

	* remez.c: The initial set of points is now randomly perturbed in
	  order to avoid singular matrices. It seems to enhance
	  considerably the behavior of the algorithm in the bad cases.

2008-04-29 11:34  clauter

	* expression.c: Patched bug in printing NaNs and Infs

2008-04-29 09:32  clauter

	  that lead to a segfault.

2008-04-27 20:09  clauter

	* expression.c: Corrected precision handling in displaying of
	  decimal values

2008-04-25 21:17  schevill

	* remez.c: Added heuristics to make the algorithm more robust.
	  Corrected few bugs as well. The code is still not perfect. It
	  seems to perform too much exchange steps. However this does not
	  compromise the algorithm.

2008-04-25 14:58  schevill

	* remez.c: Changed temporarily the maximal number of loops in remez
	  algorithm

2008-04-25 14:03  schevill

	* infnorm.c: patched a bug leading to an infinite loop in
	  dirtyinfnorm

2008-04-25 13:35  schevill

	* remez.c: MAJOR MODIFICATION: this is a first try to integrate the
	  exchange algorithm into the current implementation of remez
	  command.
	  Since it merges two different algorithms (second algorithm and
	  exchange algorithm) into a single program, I am completely unsure
	  of the stability of this new implementation.
	  However, the new implementation should always give a correct
	  minimax when it finishes normally. In the case when the Haar
	  condition is fulfilled, the algorithm should be at most twice
	  slower than the old implementation.
	  
	  This is provided as a temporary and experimental implementation
	  before a safer and faster one in the next few weeks.

2008-03-30 13:05  clauter

	* expansion.c: Added timing support for external polynomial
	  evaluation codes.

2008-02-29 05:53  schevill

	* remez.c: Corrected a bug in Remez' algorithm. More precisely,
	  when there is only
	  n+1 oscillations in the interval, we have to choose one of the
	  bounds.
	  The way it was done did not check if the alternation property was
	  fulfilled. It is now the case.

2008-02-19 01:24  schevill

	* remez.c: added a message that prints the norm of the current
	  polynomial whenever Remez' algorithm crashes because there are
	  not enough oscillations.

2008-01-16 16:26  schevill

	* execute.c: Same bug as in plot corrected for externalplot

	  but being a heuristic

	  Highly improved the quality of Taylor interval evaluations and
	  thus
	  improved the quality of the certified infinite norm by allowing
	  the
	  Taylor evaluation to recurse on the linear term up to a certain
	  level. The default level is 0, so by default, nothing changes.
	  The
	  command for setting the recursion level is
	  
	  taylorrecursions = <positive or zero integer>;

	  faire joujou que le fonction définitive

2006-05-03 17:43  schevill

	* remez.c: Remez fonctionnel. Je n'ai pas implémenté Newton, mais
	  ça marche déjà vachement bien comme ça. Nombreuses optimisations

	  on un une exponent overflow de PARI ; il s'agit d'un bug MINEUR.

2006-05-03 15:51  schevill

	* remez.c: Compilation sans warnings. Remez toujours pas
	  fonctionnel mais il faut une étape de la boucle principale et
	  devrait dores et déjà être exempt de fuite de mémoire.

	* expression.c, main.c, main.h, parser.y, remez.c: Changement de la
	  variable precision en la variable tools_precision pour cause de

	* expression.c, expression.h, infnorm.c, makefile, parser.y,
	  remez.c: Modification des noms LOG2, LOG10 et simplify. Ajout de
