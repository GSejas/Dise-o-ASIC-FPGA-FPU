  This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
  environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
  particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
  mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
  it offers a certified infinity norm, an automatic polynomial
  implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.
