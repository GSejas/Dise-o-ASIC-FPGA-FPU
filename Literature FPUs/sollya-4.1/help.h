In other words, it behaves like the identity\n   function on any type that is not a constant expression.

If the\n   function is constant or if the range is reduced to one point, the\n   function is evaluated to a constant and the constant is displayed\n   instead of a plot.\n\nExample 1: \n   > asciiplot(exp(x),[1;2]);\n                                                                             xx\n                                                                           xx  \n                                                                         xx    \n                                                                       xx      \n                                                                     xx        \n                                                                  xxx          \n                                                                xx             \n                                                             xxx               \n                                                           xx                  \n                                                        xxx                    \n                                                     xxx                       \n                                                  xxx                          \n                                               xxx                             \n                                            xxx                                \n                                        xxxx                                   \n                                     xxx                                       \n                                 xxxx                                          \n                             xxxx                                              \n                         xxxx                                                  \n                     xxxx                                                      \n                xxxxx                                                          \n           xxxxx                                                               \n      xxxxx                                                                    \n   xxx                                                                         \n\nExample 2: \n   > asciiplot(expm1(x),[-1;2]);\n                            |                                                 x\n                            |                                                x \n                            |                                               x  \n                            |                                              x   \n                            |                                            xx    \n                            |                                           x      \n                            |                                          x       \n                            |                                        xx        \n                            |                                       x          \n                            |                                     xx           \n                            |                                   xx             \n                            |                                 xx               \n                            |                               xx                 \n                            |                             xx                   \n                            |                           xx                     \n                            |                        xxx                       \n                            |                     xxx                          \n                            |                 xxxx                             \n                            |             xxxx                                 \n                            |         xxxx                                     \n                            |   xxxxxx                                         \n   ---------------------xxxxxxxx-----------------------------------------------\n            xxxxxxxxxxxx    |                                                  \n   xxxxxxxxx                |                                                  \n\nExample 3: \n   > asciiplot(5,[-1;1]);\n   5\n\nExample 4: \n   > asciiplot(exp(x),[1;1]);\n   2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369998\n\nSee also: plot, externalplot\n"

The computation\n   is performed numerically, without symbolically differentiating the expression\n   of f. Yet, the computation is safe since small interval enclosures are\n   produced. More precisely, autodiff returns a list [f_0, ..., f_n] such that,\n   for each i, f_i is a small interval enclosing the exact value of f^(i)(x0).\n\n   * Since it does not perform any symbolic differentiation, autodiff is much \n   more efficient than diff and should be prefered when only numerical values\n   are necessary.\n\n   * If an interval I is provided instead of a point x0, the list returned by\n   autodiff satisfies: for each i, f^(i)(I) is included in f_i. A particular use\n   is when one wants to know the successive derivatives of a function at a non\n   representable point such as pi. In this case, it suffices to call autodiff\n   with the (almost) point interval I = [pi].\n\n   * When I is almost a point interval, the returned enclosures f_i are also\n   almost point intervals. However, when the interval I begins to be fairly\n   large, the enclosures can be deeply overestimated due to the dependecy\n   phenomenon present with interval arithmetic.\n\n   * As a particular case, f_0 is an enclosure of the image of f over I.\n   However, since the algorithm is not specially designed for this purpose it is\n   not very efficient for this particular task. In particular, it is not able to\n   return a finite enclosure for functions with removable singularities\n   (e.g. sin(x)/x at 0). The command evaluate is much more efficient for\n   computing an accurate enclosure of the image of a function over an interval.\n\nExample 1: \n   > L = autodiff(exp(cos(x))+sin(exp(x)), 5, 0);\n   > midpointmode = on!;\n   > for f_i in L do f_i;\n   0.3559752813266941742012789792982961497379810154498~2/4~e1\n   0.5403023058681397174009366074429766037323104206179~0/3~\n   -0.3019450507398802024611853185539984893647499733880~6/2~e1\n   -0.252441295442368951995750696489089699886768918239~6/4~e1\n   0.31227898756481033145214529184139729746320579069~1/3~e1\n   -0.16634307959006696033484053579339956883955954978~3/1~e2\n\nExample 2: \n   > f = log(cos(x)+x);\n   > L = autodiff(log(cos(x)+x), 5, [2,4]);\n   > L[0];\n   [0;1.27643852425465597132446653114905059102580436018893]\n   > evaluate(f, [2,4]);\n   [0.45986058925497069206106494332976097408234056912429;1.20787210589964169595901037621103012113048821362855]\n   > fprime = diff(f);\n   > L[1];\n   [2.53086745013099407167484456656211083053393118778677e-2;1.75680249530792825137263909451182909413591288733649]\n   > evaluate(fprime,[2,4]);\n   [2.71048755415961996452136364304380881763456815673085e-2;1.10919530663943290837397225788623531405558431279949]\n\nExample 3: \n   > L = autodiff(sin(x)/x, 0, [-1,1]);\n   > L[0];\n   [-@Inf@;@Inf@]\n   > evaluate(sin(x)/x, [-1,1]);\n   [0.5403023058681397174009366074429766037323104206179;1]\n\nSee also: diff, evaluate\n"

#define HELP_EXTERNALPROC_TEXT "Name: externalproc\n==> binds an external code to a Sollya procedure\n\nUsage: \n   externalproc({identifier}, {filename}, {argumenttype} -> {resulttype}) : (identifier type, string, type type, type type) -> void\n\nParameters: \n   {identifier} represents the identifier the code is to be bound to\n   {filename} of type string represents the name of the object file where the code of procedure can be found\n   {argumenttype} represents a definition of the types of the arguments of the Sollya procedure and the external code\n   {resulttype} represents a definition of the result type of the external code\n\nDescription: \n   * externalproc allows for binding the Sollya identifier {identifier} to an\n   external code. After this binding, when Sollya encounters {identifier}\n   applied to a list of actual parameters, it will evaluate these parameters and\n   call the external code with these parameters. If the external code indicated\n   success, it will receive the result produced by the external code, transform\n   it to Sollya's internal representation and return it.\n    \n   In order to allow correct evaluation and typing of the data in parameter and\n   in result to be passed to and received from the external code, externalproc\n   has a third parameter {argumenttype} -> {resulttype}. Both {argumenttype} and\n   {resulttype} are one of void, constant, function, object, range, integer,\n   string, boolean, list of constant, list of function, list of object,\n   list of range, list of integer, list of string, list of boolean.\n    \n   It is worth mentionning that the difference between the data and\n   result type function and the type object is minimal and due to\n   support of legacy Sollya code. Both Sollya functions and Sollya\n   objects are transferred from and to the external procedure thru the C\n   type sollya_obj_t. The difference is that\n   Sollya will check that a certain object is a mathematical function\n   when function is used as a type, and will skip this test if the\n   object type is used. Similarly, Sollya relies on an object produced\n   by the external procedure to be a mathematical function when function\n   is used and will not make this assumption for object.\n    \n   If upon a usage of a procedure bound to an external procedure the type of the\n   actual parameters given or its number is not correct, Sollya produces a type\n   error. An external function not applied to arguments represents itself and\n   prints out with its argument and result types.\n    \n   The external function is supposed to return an integer indicating success. It\n   returns its result depending on its Sollya result type as follows. Here, the\n   external procedure is assumed to be implemented as a C function. \n      - If the Sollya result type is void, the C function has no pointer\n        argument for the result.\n      - If the Sollya result type is constant, the first argument of the\n        C function is of C type mpfr_t *, the result is returned by affecting\n        the MPFR variable.\n      - If the Sollya result type is function, the first argument of the\n        C function is of C type sollya_obj_t *, the result is returned by\n        affecting the sollya_obj_t variable.\n      - If the Sollya result type is object, the first argument of the\n        C function is of C type sollya_obj_t *, the result is returned by\n        affecting the sollya_obj_t variable.\n      - If the Sollya result type is range, the first argument of the C function\n        is of C type mpfi_t *, the result is returned by affecting the MPFI\n        variable.\n      - If the Sollya result type is integer, the first argument of the\n        C function is of C type int *, the result is returned by affecting the\n        int variable.\n      - If the Sollya result type is string, the first argument of the\n        C function is of C type char **, the result is returned by the char *\n        pointed with a new char *.\n      - If the Sollya result type is boolean, the first argument of the\n        C function is of C type int *, the result is returned by affecting the\n        int variable with a boolean value.\n      - If the Sollya result type is list of type, the first argument of the\n        C function is of a C type depending on the Sollya return type: \n          - For a list of constant: sollya_constant_list_t *\n          - For a list of function: sollya_obj_list_t *\n          - For a list of object: sollya_obj_list_t *\n          - For a list of range: sollya_constant_list_t *\n          - For a list of integer: sollya_int_list_t *\n          - For a list of string: sollya_string_list_t *\n          - For a list of boolean: sollya_boolean_list_t *  \n    \n   The external procedure affects its possible pointer argument if and only if\n   it succeeds. This means, if the function returns an integer indicating\n   failure, it does not leak any memory to the encompassing environment.\n    \n   The external procedure receives its arguments as follows: If the Sollya\n   argument type is void, no argument array is given. Otherwise the C function\n   receives a C void ** argument representing an array of size equal to the\n   arity of the function where each entry (of C type void *) represents a value\n   with a C type depending on the corresponding Sollya type. \n      - If the Sollya type is constant, the void * is to be cast to mpfr_t *.\n      - If the Sollya type is function, the void * is to be cast to\n        sollya_obj_t.\n      - If the Sollya type is object, the void * is to be cast to sollya_obj_t.\n      - If the Sollya type is range, the void * is to be cast to mpfi_t *.\n      - If the Sollya type is integer, the void * is to be cast to int *.\n      - If the Sollya type is string, the void * is to be cast to char *.\n      - If the Sollya type is boolean, the void * is to be cast to int *.\n      - If the Sollya type is list of type, the void * is to be cast to a list\n        of a type depending on the type of the list argument: \n          - For a list of constant: sollya_constant_list_t\n          - For a list of function: sollya_obj_list_t\n          - For a list of object: sollya_obj_list_t\n          - For a list of range: sollya_interval_list_t\n          - For a list of integer: sollya_int_list_t\n          - For a list of string: sollya_string_list_t\n          - For a list of boolean: sollya_boolean_list_t  \n    \n   The external procedure is not supposed to alter the memory pointed by its\n   array argument void **.\n    \n   In both directions (argument and result values), empty lists are represented\n   by NULL pointers.\n    \n   Similarly to internal procedures, externally bounded procedures can be\n   considered to be objects inside Sollya that can be assigned to other\n   variables, stored in list etc.\n\n   * The dynamic object file whose name is given to externalproc for binding of an\n   external procedure may also define a destructor function int sollya_external_lib_close(void).\n   If Sollya finds such a destructor function in the dynamic object file, it will call \n   that function when closing the dynamic object file again. This happens when Sollya\n   is terminated or when the current Sollya session is restarted using restart.\n   The purpose of the destructor function is to allow the dynamically bound code\n   to free any memory that it might have allocated before Sollya is terminated \n   or restarted. \n   The dynamic object file is not necessarily needed to define a destructor\n   function. This ensure backward compatibility with older Sollya external \n   library function object files.\n   When defined, the destructor function is supposed to return an integer\n   value indicating if an error has happened. Upon success, the destructor\n   functions is to return a zero value, upon error a non-zero value.\n\nExample 1: \n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -Wall -c externalprocexample.c\");\n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -shared -o externalprocexample externalprocexample.o\");\n   > externalproc(foo, \"./externalprocexample\", (integer, integer) -> integer);\n   > foo;\n   foo(integer, integer) -> integer\n   > foo(5, 6);\n   11\n   > verbosity = 1!;\n   > foo();\n   Warning: at least one of the given expressions or a subexpression is not correctly typed\n   or its evaluation has failed because of some error on a side-effect.\n   error\n   > a = foo;\n   > a(5,6);\n   11\n\nSee also: library, libraryconstant, externalplot, bashexecute, void, constant, function, range, integer, string, boolean, list of, object\n"

See the detailed description below.\n   {P} (optional) is the minimax polynomial to be considered for solving the problem.\n\nDescription: \n   * fpminimax uses a heuristic (but practically efficient) method to find a\n   good polynomial approximation of a function {f} on an interval {range}. It\n   implements the method published in the article: \n   Efficient polynomial L^\\infty - approximations\n   Nicolas Brisebarre and Sylvain Chevillard \n   Proceedings of the 18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH 18) \n   pp. 169-176\n\n   * The basic usage of this command is fpminimax({f}, {n}, {formats}, {range}).\n   It computes a polynomial approximation of f with degree at most n\n   on the interval {range}. {formats} is a list of integers or format types\n   (such as double, doubledouble, etc.). The polynomial returned by the\n   command has its coefficients that fit the formats indications. For\n   instance, if formats[0] is 35, the coefficient of degree 0 of the\n   polynomial will fit a floating-point format of 35 bits. If formats[1]\n   is D, the coefficient of degree 1 will be representable by a floating-point\n   number with a precision of 53 bits (which is not necessarily an IEEE 754\n   double precision number. See the remark below), etc.\n\n   * The second argument may be either an integer, a list of integers or a list\n   of functions. An integer indicates the degree of the desired polynomial\n   approximation. A list of integers indicates the list of desired monomials.\n   For instance, the list [|0,2,4,6|] indicates that the polynomial must be\n   even and of degree at most 6. Giving an integer n as second argument is\n   equivalent as giving [|0,...,n|].\n   Finally, a list of function g_k indicates that the desired approximation\n   must be a linear combination of the g_k. \n   The list of formats is interpreted with respect to the list of monomials. For\n   instance, if the list of monomials is [|0,2,4,6|] and the list\n   of formats is [|161,107,53,24|], the coefficients of degree 0 is\n   searched as a floating-point number with precision 161, the coefficient of\n   degree 2 is searched as a number of precision 107, and so on.\n\n   * The list of formats may contain either integers or format types\n   (halfprecision, single, double, doubledouble, tripledouble, doubleextended\n   and quad). The list may be too large or even infinite. Only the first\n   indications will be considered. For instance, for a degree n polynomial,\n   formats[n+1] and above will be discarded. This lets one use elliptical\n   indications for the last coefficients.\n\n   * The floating-point coefficients considered by fpminimax do not have an\n   exponent range. In particular, in the format list, double is an exact synonym\n   for 53. Currently, fpminimax only ensures that the corresponding coefficient\n   has at most 53 bits of mantissa. It does not imply that it is an\n   IEEE-754 double.\n\n   * By default, the list of formats is interpreted as a list of floating-point\n   formats. This may be changed by passing fixed as an optional argument (see\n   below). Let us take an example: fpminimax(f, 2, [107, DD, 53], [0;1]).\n   Here the optional argument is missing (we could have set it to floating).\n   Thus, fpminimax will search for a polynomial of degree 2 with a constant\n   coefficient that is a 107 bits floating-point number, etc. \n   Currently, doubledouble is just a synonym for 107 and tripledouble a\n   synonym for 161. This behavior may change in the future (taking into\n   account the fact that some double-doubles are not representable with\n   107 bits). \n   Second example: fpminimax(f, 2, [25, 18, 30], [0;1], fixed).\n   In this case, fpminimax will search for a polynomial of degree 2 with a\n   constant coefficient of the form m/2^25 where m is an\n   integer. In other words, it is a fixed-point number with 25 bits after\n   the point. Note that even with argument fixed, the formats list is\n   allowed to contain halfprecision, single, double, doubleextended,\n   doubledouble, quad or tripledouble. In this this case, it is just\n   a synonym for 11, 24, 53, 64, 107, 113 or 161. This is deprecated and\n   may change in the future.\n\n   * The fourth argument may be a range or a list. Lists are for advanced users\n   that know what they are doing. The core of the  method is a kind of\n   approximated interpolation. The list given here is a list of points that\n   must be considered for the interpolation. It must contain at least as\n   many points as unknown coefficients. If you give a list, it is also\n   recommended that you provide the minimax polynomial as last argument.\n   If you give a range, the list of points will be automatically computed.\n\n   * The fifth, sixth and seventh arguments are optional. By default, fpminimax\n   will approximate f while optimizing the relative error, and interpreting\n   the list of formats as a list of floating-point formats. \n   This default behavior may be changed with these optional arguments. You\n   may provide zero, one, two or three of the arguments in any order.\n   This lets the user indicate only the non-default arguments. \n   The three possible arguments are:  \n       - relative or absolute: the error to be optimized;\n       - floating or fixed: formats of the coefficients;\n       - a constrained part q.\n    \n   The constrained part lets the user assign in advance some of the\n   coefficients. For instance, for approximating exp(x), it may\n   be interesting to search for a polynomial p of the form\n                   p = 1 + x + x^2/2 + a3 x^3 + a4 x^4.\n   Thus, there is a constrained part q = 1 + x + x^2/2 and the unknown\n   polynomial should be considered in the monomial basis [|3, 4|].\n   Calling fpminimax with monomial basis [|3,4|] and constrained\n   part q, will return a polynomial with the right form.\n\n   * The last argument is for advanced users. It is the minimax polynomial that\n   approximates the function f in the given basis. If it is not given\n   this polynomial will be automatically computed by fpminimax.\n    \n   This minimax polynomial is used to compute the list of interpolation\n   points required by the method. It is also used, when floating-point\n   coefficients are desired, to give an initial assumption for the\n   exponents of the coeffcients. In general, you do not have to provide this\n   argument. But if you want to obtain several polynomials of the same degree\n   that approximate the same function on the same range, just changing the\n   formats, you should probably consider computing only once the minimax\n   polynomial and the list of points instead of letting fpminimax recompute\n   them each time.\n    \n   Note that in the case when a constrained part is given, the minimax\n   polynomial must take that into account. For instance, in the previous\n   example, the minimax would be obtained by the following command:\n          P = remez(1-(1+x+x^2/2)/exp(x), [|3,4|], range, 1/exp(x));\n   Note that the constrained part is not to be added to P.\n    \n   In the case when the second argument is an integer or a list of integers,\n   there is no restriction for P, as long as it is a polynomial.\n   However, when the second argument is a list of functions, and even if these\n   functions are all polynomials, P must be expanded in the given basis.\n   For instance, if the second argument is 2 or [|0, 1, 2|], P can be given\n   in Horner form. However, if the second argument is [|1, x, x^2|], P must\n   be written as a linear combination of 1, x and x^2, otherwise, the algorithm\n   will fail to recover the coefficients of P and will fail with an error\n   message.\n    \n   Please also note that recovering the coefficients of P in an arbitrary\n   basis is performed heuristically and no verification is performed to check\n   that P does not contain other functions than the functions of the basis.\n\n   * Note that fpminimax internally computes a minimax polynomial (using\n   the same algorithm as remez command). Thus fpminimax may encounter\n   the same problems as remez. In particular, it may be very slow\n   when Haar condition is not fulfilled. Another consequence is that\n   currently fpminimax has to be run with a sufficiently high working precision.\n\nExample 1: \n   > P = fpminimax(cos(x),6,[|DD, DD, D...|],[-1b-5;1b-5]);\n   > printexpansion(P);\n   (0x3ff0000000000000 + 0xbc09fda15e029b00) + x * ((0x3af9eb57163024a8 + 0x37942c2f3f3e3839) + x * (0xbfdfffffffffff98 + x * (0xbbd1693f9c028849 + x * (0x3fa5555555145337 + x * (0x3c7a25f610ad9ebc + x * 0xbf56c138142da5b0)))))\n\nExample 2: \n   > P = fpminimax(sin(x),6,[|32...|],[-1b-5;1b-5], fixed, absolute);\n   > display = powers!;\n   > P;\n   x * (1 + x^2 * (-357913941 * 2^(-31) + x^2 * (35789873 * 2^(-32))))\n\nExample 3: \n   > P = fpminimax(exp(x), [|3,4|], [|D,24|], [-1/256; 1/246], 1+x+x^2/2);\n   > display = powers!;\n   > P;\n   1 + x * (1 + x * (1 * 2^(-1) + x * (375300225001191 * 2^(-51) + x * (5592621 * 2^(-27)))))\n\nExample 4: \n   > f = cos(exp(x));\n   > pstar = remez(f, 5, [-1b-7;1b-7]);\n   > listpoints = dirtyfindzeros(f-pstar, [-1b-7; 1b-7]);\n   > P1 = fpminimax(f, 5, [|DD...|], listpoints, absolute, default, default, pstar);\n   > P2 = fpminimax(f, 5, [|D...|], listpoints, absolute, default, default, pstar);\n   > P3 = fpminimax(f, 5, [|D, D, D, 24...|], listpoints, absolute, default, default, pstar);\n   > print(\"Error of pstar: \", dirtyinfnorm(f-pstar, [-1b-7; 1b-7]));\n   Error of pstar:  7.9048441259903026332577436001060063099817726177425e-16\n   > print(\"Error of P1:    \", dirtyinfnorm(f-P1, [-1b-7; 1b-7]));\n   Error of P1:     7.9048441259903026580081299123420463921479618202064e-16\n   > print(\"Error of P2:    \", dirtyinfnorm(f-P2, [-1b-7; 1b-7]));\n   Error of P2:     8.2477144579950871737109573536791331686347620955984e-16\n   > print(\"Error of P3:    \", dirtyinfnorm(f-P3, [-1b-7; 1b-7]));\n   Error of P3:     1.08454277156993282593701156841863009789063333951055e-15\n\nExample 5: \n   > L = [|exp(x), sin(x), cos(x)-1, sin(x^3)|];\n   > g = (2^x-1)/x;\n   > p = fpminimax(g, L, [|D...|], [-1/16;1/16],absolute);\n   > display = powers!;\n   > p;\n   -3267884797436153 * 2^(-54) * sin(x^3) + 5247089102535885 * 2^(-53) * (cos(x) - 1) + -8159095033730771 * 2^(-54) * sin(x) + 6243315658446641 * 2^(-53) * exp(x)\n\nExample 6: \n   > n = 9;\n   > T = [|1, x|];\n   > for i from 2 to n do T[i] = canonical(2*x*T[i-1]-T[i-2]);\n   > g = (2^x-1)/x;\n   > PCheb = fpminimax(g, T, [|DD,DE...|], [-1/16;1/16],absolute);\n   > display = dyadic!;\n   > print(PCheb);\n   8733930098894247371b-98 * (9 * x + -120 * x^3 + 432 * x^5 + -576 * x^7 + 256 * x^9) + 15750497046710770365b-94 * (1 + -32 * x^2 + 160 * x^4 + -256 * x^6 + 128 * x^8) + 6467380330985872933b-88 * (-7 * x + 56 * x^3 + -112 * x^5 + 64 * x^7) + 9342762606926218927b-84 * (-1 + 18 * x^2 + -48 * x^4 + 32 * x^6) + 11814521367456461131b-80 * (5 * x + -20 * x^3 + 16 * x^5) + 6405479474328570593b-75 * (1 + -8 * x^2 + 8 * x^4) + 11584457324781949889b-72 * (-3 * x + 4 * x^3) + 16779705312447201161b-69 * (-1 + 2 * x^2) + 18265014280997359319b-66 * x + 117054497448175143902009975397253b-107\n\nSee also: remez, dirtyfindzeros, absolute, relative, fixed, floating, default, halfprecision, single, double, doubleextended, doubledouble, quad, tripledouble, implementpoly, coeff, degree, roundcoefficients, guessdegree\n"

In some cases however,\n   it is interesting to use such Computer Science procedures as\n   realisations of mathematical functions, e.g. in order to plot them or\n   even to perform polynomial approximation on them. The function keyword\n   allows for such a transformation of a Sollya procedure into a Sollya\n   function. \n\n   * The procedure to be used as a function through function({procedure})\n   must be of type (range, integer, integer)\n   -> range. This means it must take in argument\n   an interval X, a degree of differentiation n and a\n   working precision p. It must return in result an interval\n   Y encompassing the image f^(n)(X) of the\n   n-th derivative of the implemented function f,\n   i.e. f^(n)(X) c Y. In order to allow\n   Sollya's algorithms to work properly, the procedure must ensure that,\n   whenever (p, diam(X)) tends to (infinity, 0),\n   the computed over-estimated bounding Y tends to the actual image f^(n)(X).\n\n   * The user must be aware that they are responsible of the correctness\n   of the procedure. If, for some n and X, {procedure} returns an interval Y\n   such that f^n(X) is not included in Y, function will successfully\n   return a function without any complain, but this function might behave\n   inconsistently in further computations.\n\n   * For cases when the procedure does not have the correct signature or\n   does not return a finite interval as a result function({procedure})\n   evaluates to Not-A-Number (resp. to an interval of Not-A-Numbers for\n   interval evaluation).\n\n   * function also represents the function type for declarations\n   of external procedures by means of externalproc.\n    \n   Remark that in contrast to other indicators, type indicators like\n   function cannot be handled outside the externalproc context.

Since\n   the same problem may exist for f'/g', the rule is applied recursively.\n   The number of step in this recursion process is controlled by hopitalrecursions.\n\n   * Setting hopitalrecursions to 0 makes Sollya use this rule only once;\n   setting it to 1 makes Sollya use the rule twice, and so on.\n   In particular: the rule is always applied at least once, if necessary.\n\nExample 1: \n   > hopitalrecursions=0;\n   The number of recursions for Hopital's rule has been set to 0.\n   > evaluate(log(1+x)^2/x^2,[-1/2; 1]);\n   [-@Inf@;@Inf@]\n   > hopitalrecursions=1;\n   The number of recursions for Hopital's rule has been set to 1.\n   > evaluate(log(1+x)^2/x^2,[-1/2; 1]);\n   [-2.52258872223978123766892848583270627230200053744108;6.7725887222397812376689284858327062723020005374411]\n\nSee also: taylorrecursions, infnorm, findzeros, evaluate\n"

More precisely, it generates the source code (written\n   in C, and using MPFR) of a C function const_something with the following\n   signature:\n    \n             void const_something (mpfr_ptr y, mp_prec_t prec)\n    \n   Let us denote by c the exact mathematical value of the constant defined by\n   the expression {expr}. When called with arguments y and prec (where the\n   variable y is supposed to be already initialized), the function\n   mpfr_const_something sets the precision of y to a suitable precision and\n   stores in it an approximate value of c such that\n                               |y-c| <= |c|*2^(1-prec).\n\n   * When no filename {filename} is given or if default is given as\n   {filename}, the source code produced by implementconstant is printed on\n   standard output. Otherwise, when {filename} is given as a \n   string of characters, the source code is output to a file \n   named {filename}. If that file cannot be opened and/or \n   written to, implementconstant fails and has no other effect.\n\n   * When {functionname} is given as an argument to implementconstant and\n   {functionname} evaluates to a string of characters, the default name\n   for the C function const_something is\n   replaced by {functionname}. When default is given as {functionname},\n   the default name is used nevertheless, as if no {functionname}\n   argument were given.  When choosing a character sequence for\n   {functionname}, the user should keep attention to the fact that\n   {functionname} must be a valid C identifier in order to enable\n   error-free compilation of the produced code.\n\n   * If {expr} refers to a constant defined with libraryconstant, the produced\n   code uses the external code implementing this constant. The user should\n   keep in mind that it is up to them to make sure the symbol for that \n   external code can get resolved when the newly generated code is to \n   be loaded.\n\n   * If a subexpression of {expr} evaluates to 0, implementconstant will most\n   likely fail with an error message.\n\n   * implementconstant is unable to implement constant expressions {expr} that\n   contain procedure-based functions, i.e. functions created from Sollya\n   procedures using the function construct. If {expr} contains such a\n   procedure-based function, implementconstant prints a warning and fails\n   silently. The reason for this lack of functionality is that the\n   produced C source code, which is supposed to be compiled, would have\n   to call back to the Sollya interpreter in order to evaluate the\n   procedure-based function.\n\n   * Similarily, implementconstant is currently unable to implement constant\n   expressions {expr} that contain library-based functions, i.e.\n   functions dynamically bound to Sollya using the library construct.\n   If {expr} contains such a library-based function, implementconstant prints\n   a warning and fails silently. Support for this feature is in principle\n   feasible from a technical standpoint and might be added in a future\n   release of Sollya.\n\n   * Currently, non-differentiable functions such as double, doubledouble,\n   tripledouble, single, halfprecision, quad, doubleextended, \n   floor, ceil, nearestint are not supported by implementconstant. \n   If implementconstant encounters one of them, a warning message is displayed \n   and no code is produced. However, if autosimplify equals on, it is \n   possible that Sollya silently simplifies subexpressions of {expr} \n   containing such functions and that implementconstant successfully produces \n   code for evaluating {expr}.\n\n   * While it produces an MPFR-based C source code for {expr}, implementconstant\n   takes architectural and system-dependent parameters into account.  For\n   example, it checks whether literal constants figuring in {expr} can be\n   represented on a C long int type or if they must\n   be stored in a different manner not to affect their accuracy. These\n   tests, performed by Sollya during execution of implementconstant, depend\n   themselves on the architecture Sollya is running on. Users should\n   keep this matter in mind, especially when trying to compile source\n   code on one machine whilst it has been produced on another.\n\nExample 1: \n   > implementconstant(exp(1)+log(2)/sqrt(1/10));\n   /*\n       This code was generated using non-trivial code generation commands of\n       the Sollya software program.\n       \n       Before using, modifying and/or integrating this code into other\n       software, review the copyright and license status of this generated\n       code.

The\n   argument {format} indicates the double, double-double or triple-double\n   format of the variable in which the polynomial varies, influencing\n   also in the signature of the C function.\n    \n   If a seventh or eighth argument {proof filename} is given and if this\n   argument evaluates to a variable of type string, the command\n   implementpoly will produce a Gappa proof that the\n   rounding error is less than the given bound. This proof will be output\n   in Gappa syntax in a file name {proof filename}.\n    \n   The command implementpoly returns the polynomial that has been\n   implemented. As the command implementpoly tries to adapt the precision\n   needed in each evaluation step to its strict minimum and as it applies\n   renormalization to double-double and triple-double precision\n   coefficients to bring them to a round-to-nearest expansion form, the\n   returned polynomial may differ from the polynomial\n   {polynomial}. Nevertheless the difference will be small enough that\n   the rounding error bound with regard to the polynomial {polynomial}\n   (estimated at its first order) will be less than the given error\n   bound.\n    \n   If a seventh argument {honor coefficient precisions} is given and\n   evaluates to a variable honorcoeffprec of type honorcoeffprec,\n   implementpoly will honor the precision of the given polynomial\n   {polynomials}. This means if a coefficient needs a double-double or a\n   triple-double to be exactly stored, implementpoly will allocate appropriate\n   space and use a double-double or triple-double operation even if the\n   automatic (heuristic) determination implemented in command implementpoly\n   indicates that the coefficient could be stored on less precision or,\n   respectively, the operation could be performed with less\n   precision. The use of honorcoeffprec has advantages and\n   disadvantages. If the polynomial {polynomial} given has not been\n   determined by a process considering directly polynomials with\n   floating-point coefficients, honorcoeffprec should not be\n   indicated. The implementpoly command can then determine the needed\n   precision using the same error estimation as used for the\n   determination of the precisions of the operations. Generally, the\n   coefficients will get rounded to double, double-double and\n   triple-double precision in a way that minimizes their number and\n   respects the rounding error bound {error bound}.  Indicating\n   honorcoeffprec may in this case short-circuit most precision\n   estimations leading to sub-optimal code. On the other hand, if the\n   polynomial {polynomial} has been determined with floating-point\n   precisions in mind, honorcoeffprec should be indicated because such\n   polynomials often are very sensitive in terms of error propagation with\n   regard to their coefficients' values. Indicating honorcoeffprec\n   prevents the implementpoly command from rounding the coefficients and\n   altering by many orders of magnitude the approximation error of the\n   polynomial with regard to the function it approximates.\n    \n   The implementer behind the implementpoly command makes some assumptions on\n   its input and verifies them. If some assumption cannot be verified,\n   the implementation will not succeed and implementpoly will evaluate to a\n   variable error of type error. The same behaviour is observed if\n   some file is not writable or some other side-effect fails, e.g. if\n   the implementer runs out of memory.\n    \n   As error estimation is performed only on the first order, the code\n   produced by the implementpoly command should be considered valid iff a\n   Gappa proof has been produced and successfully run\n   in Gappa.\n\nExample 1: \n   > implementpoly(1 - 1/6 * x^2 + 1/120 * x^4, [-1b-10;1b-10], 1b-30, D, \"p\",\"implementation.c\");\n   1 + x^2 * (-0.166666666666666657414808128123695496469736099243164 + x^2 * 8.3333333333333332176851016015461937058717012405395e-3)\n   > readfile(\"implementation.c\");\n   /*\n       This code was generated using non-trivial code generation commands of\n       the Sollya software program.\n       \n       Before using, modifying and/or integrating this code into other\n       software, review the copyright and license status of this generated\n       code.

U I2).\n\n   * The function {f} is assumed to be at least twice continuous on {I}. More \n   generally, if {f} is Ck, global variables hopitalrecursions and\n   taylorrecursions must have values not greater than k.  \n\n   * If the interval is reduced to a single point, the result of infnorm is an \n   interval containing the exact absolute value of {f} at this point.\n\n   * If the interval is not bound, the result will be [0, +Inf] \n   which is correct but perfectly useless. infnorm is not meant to be used with \n   infinite intervals.\n\n   * The result of this command depends on the global variables prec, diam,\n   taylorrecursions and hopitalrecursions. The contribution of each variable is \n   not easy even to analyse.\n    \n      - The algorithm uses interval arithmetic with precision prec. The\n        precision should thus be set high enough to ensure that no critical\n        cancellation will occur.\n      - When an evaluation is performed on an interval [a,b], if the result\n        is considered being too large, the interval is split into [a,(a+b)/2]\n        and [(a+b)/2,b] and so on recursively. This recursion step\n        is  not performed if the (b-a) < d*|I| where d is the value\n        of variable diam. In other words, diam controls the minimum length of an\n        interval during the algorithm.\n      - To perform the evaluation of a function on an interval, Taylor's rule is\n        applied, e.g. f([a,b]) C f(m) + [a-m, b-m]*f'([a,b])\n        where m=(a+b)/2. This rule is recursively applied n times\n        where n is the value of variable taylorrecursions. Roughly speaking,\n        the evaluations will avoid decorrelation up to order n.\n      - When a function of the form g/h has to be evaluated on an\n        interval [a,b] and when g and h vanish at a same point\n        z of the interval, the ratio may be defined even if the expression\n        g(z)/h(z)=0/0 does not make any sense. In this case, L'Hopital's rule\n        may be used and (g/h)([a,b]) C (g'/h')([a,b]).\n        Since the same can occur with the ratio g'/h', the rule is applied\n        recursively. The variable hopitalrecursions controls the number of \n        recursion steps.\n    \n\n   * The algorithm used for this command is quite complex to be explained here. \n   Please find a complete description in the following article:\n        S. Chevillard and C. Lauter\n        A certified infinity norm for the implementation of elementary functions\n        LIP Research Report number RR2007-26\n        http://prunel.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ensl-00119810\n\n   * Users should be aware about the fact that the algorithm behind\n   infnorm is inefficient in most cases and that other, better suited\n   algorithms, such as supnorm, are available inside Sollya. As a\n   matter of fact, while infnorm is maintained for compatibility reasons\n   with legacy Sollya codes, users are advised to avoid using infnorm\n   in new Sollya scripts and to replace it, where possible, by the\n   supnorm command.\n\nExample 1: \n   > infnorm(exp(x),[-2;3]);\n   [2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385537e1;2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385544e1]\n\nExample 2: \n   > infnorm(exp(x),[-2;3],\"proof.txt\");\n   [2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385537e1;2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385544e1]\n\nExample 3: \n   > infnorm(exp(x),[-2;3],[| [0;1], [2;2.5] |]);\n   [2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385537e1;2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385544e1]\n\nExample 4: \n   > infnorm(exp(x),[-2;3],\"proof.txt\", [| [0;1], [2;2.5] |]);\n   [2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385537e1;2.00855369231876677409285296545817178969879078385544e1]\n\nExample 5: \n   > infnorm(exp(x),[1;1]);\n   [2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369989;2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369998]\n\nExample 6: \n   > infnorm(exp(x), [log(0);log(1)]);\n   [0;@Inf@]\n\nSee also: prec, diam, hopitalrecursions, taylorrecursions, dirtyinfnorm, checkinfnorm, supnorm, findzeros, diff, taylorrecursions, autodiff, numberroots, taylorform\n"

These procedures are common Sollya objects that can be\n   applied to actual parameters after definition. Upon such an\n   application, the Sollya interpreter applies the actual parameters to\n   the formal parameters {formal parameter1} through {formal parameter n}\n   (resp. builds up the list of arguments and applies it to the list\n   {formal list parameter}) and executes the {procedure body}. The\n   procedure applied to actual parameters evaluates then to the\n   expression {expression} in the return statement after the {procedure body} \n   or to void, if no return statement is given (i.e. a return\n   void statement is implicitly given).\n\n   * Sollya procedures defined by proc have no name. They can be bound\n   to an identifier by assigning the procedure object a proc\n   expression produces to an identifier. However, it is possible to use\n   procedures without giving them any name. For instance, Sollya\n   procedures, i.e. procedure objects, can be elements of lists. They can\n   even be given as an argument to other internal Sollya procedures. See\n   also procedure on this subject.\n\n   * Upon definition of a Sollya procedure using proc, no type check\n   is performed. More precisely, the statements in {procedure body} are\n   merely parsed but not interpreted upon procedure definition with\n   proc. Type checks are performed once the procedure is applied to\n   actual parameters or to void. At this time, if the procedure was\n   defined using several different formal parameters {formal parameter 1}\n   through {formal parameter n}, it is checked whether the number of\n   actual parameters corresponds to the number of formal parameters. If\n   the procedure was defined using the syntax for a procedure with an\n   arbitrary number of parameters by giving a {formal list parameter},\n   the number of actual arguments is not checked but only a list <formal\n   list parameter> of appropriate length is built up. Type checks are\n   further performed upon execution of each statement in {procedure body}\n   and upon evaluation of the expression {expression} to be returned.\n    \n   Procedures defined by proc containing a quit or restart command\n   cannot be executed (i.e. applied). Upon application of a procedure,\n   the Sollya interpreter checks beforehand for such a statement. If one\n   is found, the application of the procedure to its arguments evaluates\n   to error. A warning is displayed. Remark that in contrast to other\n   type or semantic correctness checks, this check is really performed\n   before interpreting any other statement in the body of the procedure.\n\n   * Through the var keyword it is possible to declare local\n   variables and thus to have full support of recursive procedures. This\n   means a procedure defined using proc may contain in its {procedure body} \n   an application of itself to some actual parameters: it suffices\n   to assign the procedure (object) to an identifier with an appropriate\n   name.\n\n   * Sollya procedures defined using proc may return other\n   procedures. Further {procedure body} may contain assignments of\n   locally defined procedure objects to identifiers. See var for the\n   particular behaviour of local and global variables.\n\n   * The expression {expression} returned by a procedure is evaluated with\n   regard to Sollya commands, procedures and external\n   procedures. Simplification may be performed.  However, an application\n   of a procedure defined by proc to actual parameters evaluates to the\n   expression {expression} that may contain the free global variable or\n   that may be composed.\n\nExample 1: \n   > succ = proc(n) { return n + 1; };\n   > succ(5);\n   6\n   > 3 + succ(0);\n   4\n   > succ;\n   proc(n)\n   {\n   nop;\n   return (n) + (1);\n   }\n\nExample 2: \n   > add = proc(m,n) { var res; res := m + n; return res; };\n   > add(5,6);\n   11\n   > add;\n   proc(m, n)\n   {\n   var res;\n   res := (m) + (n);\n   return res;\n   }\n   > verbosity = 1!;\n   > add(3);\n   Warning: at least one of the given expressions or a subexpression is not correctly typed\n   or its evaluation has failed because of some error on a side-effect.\n   error\n   > add(true,false);\n   Warning: at least one of the given expressions or a subexpression is not correctly typed\n   or its evaluation has failed because of some error on a side-effect.\n   Warning: the given expression or command could not be handled.\n   error\n\nExample 3: \n   > succ = proc(n) { return n + 1; };\n   > succ(5);\n   6\n   > succ(x);\n   1 + x\n\nExample 4: \n   > hey = proc() { print(\"Hello world.\"); };\n   > hey();\n   Hello world.\n   > print(hey());\n   Hello world.\n   void\n   > hey;\n   proc()\n   {\n   print(\"Hello world.\");\n   return void;\n   }\n\nExample 5: \n   > fac = proc(n) { var res; if (n == 0) then res := 1 else res := n * fac(n - 1); return res; };\n   > fac(5);\n   120\n   > fac(11);\n   39916800\n   > fac;\n   proc(n)\n   {\n   var res;\n   if (n) == (0) then\n   res := 1\n   else\n   res := (n) * (fac((n) - (1)));\n   return res;\n   }\n\nExample 6: \n   > myprocs = [| proc(m,n) { return m + n; }, proc(m,n) { return m - n; } |];\n   > (myprocs[0])(5,6);\n   11\n   > (myprocs[1])(5,6);\n   -1\n   > succ = proc(n) { return n + 1; };\n   > pred = proc(n) { return n - 1; };\n   > applier = proc(p,n) { return p(n); };\n   > applier(succ,5);\n   6\n   > applier(pred,5);\n   4\n\nExample 7: \n   > verbosity = 1!;\n   > myquit = proc(n) { print(n); quit; };\n   > myquit;\n   proc(n)\n   {\n   print(n);\n   quit;\n   return void;\n   }\n   > myquit(5);\n   Warning: a quit or restart command may not be part of a procedure body.\n   The procedure will not be executed.\n   Warning: an error occurred while executing a procedure.\n   Warning: the given expression or command could not be handled.\n   error\n\nExample 8: \n   > printsucc = proc(n) { var succ; succ = proc(n) { return n + 1; }; print(\"Successor of\",n,\"is\",succ(n)); };\n   > printsucc(5);\n   Successor of 5 is 6\n\nExample 9: \n   > makeadd = proc(n) { var add; print(\"n =\",n); add = proc(m,n) { return n + m; }; return add; };\n   > makeadd(4);\n   n = 4\n   proc(m, n)\n   {\n   nop;\n   return (n) + (m);\n   }\n   > (makeadd(4))(5,6);\n   n = 4\n   11\n\nExample 10: \n   > sumall = proc(L = ...) { var acc, i; acc = 0; for i in L do acc = acc + i; return acc; };\n   > sumall;\n   proc(L = ...)\n   {\n   var acc, i;\n   acc = 0;\n   for i in L do\n   acc = (acc) + (i);\n   return acc;\n   }\n   > sumall();\n   0\n   > sumall(2);\n   2\n   > sumall(2,5);\n   7\n   > sumall(2,5,7,9,16);\n   39\n   > sumall @ [|1,...,10|];\n   55\n\nSee also: return, externalproc, void, quit, restart, var, @, bind, error\n"

Default is 1e-5.\n   {bounds} (optional) is a parameter that allows the user to make the algorithm stop earlier, whenever a given accuracy is reached or a given accuracy is proved unreachable. Default is [0, +Inf].\n\nDescription: \n   * remez computes an approximation of the function f with respect to\n   the weight function w on the interval {range}. More precisely, it\n   searches p such that ||p*w-f|| is\n   (almost) minimal among all p of a certain form. The norm is\n   the infinity norm, e.g. ||g|| = max {|g(x)|, x in {range}}.\n\n   * If w=1 (the default case), it consists in searching the best\n   polynomial approximation of f with respect to the absolute error.\n   If f=1 and w is of the form 1/g, it consists in\n   searching the best polynomial approximation of g with respect to the\n   relative error.\n\n   * If n is given, p is searched among the polynomials with degree not\n   greater than n.\n   If {L} is given and is a list of integers, p is searched as a linear\n   combination of monomials X^k where k belongs to {L}.\n   In the case when {L} is a list of integers, it may contain ellipses but\n   cannot be end-elliptic.\n   If {L} is given and is a list of functions g_k, p is searched as a\n   linear combination of the g_k. In that case {L} cannot contain ellipses.\n   It is the user responsability to check that the g_k are linearly independent\n   over the interval {range}. Moreover, the functions w*g_k must be at least\n   twice differentiable over {range}. If these conditions are not fulfilled, the\n   algorithm might fail or even silently return a result as if it successfully\n   found the minimax, though the returned p is not optimal.\n\n   * The polynomial is obtained by a convergent iteration called Remez'\n   algorithm (and an extension of this algorithm, due to Stiefel).\n   The algorithm computes a sequence p1, ..., pk, ...\n   such that ek = ||pk*w-f|| converges towards\n   the optimal value e. The algorithm is stopped when the relative error\n   between ek and e is less than {quality}.\n\n   * The optional argument {bounds} is an interval [satisfying_err, target_err]\n   with the following behavior: \n     - if, during the algorithm, we manage to prove that target_err is\n       unreachable, we stop the algorithm returning the last computed\n       polynomial.\n     - if, during the algorithm, we obtain a polynomial with an error smaller\n       than satisfying_err, we stop the algorithm returning that polynomial.\n     - otherwise we loop until we find an optimal polynomial with the required\n       quality, as usual. \n   Examples of use: \n     [0, +Inf] (compute the optimal polynomial with the required quality) \n     [target_err] (stops as soon as a polynomial achieving target_err is\n                   obtained or as soon as such a polynomial is proved not to\n                   exist). \n     [0, target_err] (finds the optimal polynomial, but provided that its error\n                      is smaller than target_err). \n     [satisfying_err, +Inf] (stops as soon as a polynomial achieving\n                             satisfying_err is obtained. If such a polynomial\n                             does not exist, returns the optimal polynomial).\n\nExample 1: \n   > p = remez(exp(x),5,[0;1]);\n   > degree(p);\n   5\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p-exp(x),[0;1]);\n   1.12956981510961487071711938292660776072226345893629e-6\n\nExample 2: \n   > p = remez(1,[|0,2,4,6,8|],[0,Pi/4],1/cos(x));\n   > canonical=on!;\n   > p;\n   0.99999999994393732180959690352543887130348096061124 + -0.499999995715568577687720530637215446709494672222587 * x^2 + 4.1666613233473633009941059480570275870113220089059e-2 * x^4 + -1.3886529147145693651355523880319714051047635695061e-3 * x^6 + 2.4372679177224179934800328511009205218114284220126e-5 * x^8\n\nExample 3: \n   > p1 = remez(exp(x),5,[0;1],default,1e-5);\n   > p2 = remez(exp(x),5,[0;1],default,1e-10);\n   > p3 = remez(exp(x),5,[0;1],default,1e-15);\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p1-exp(x),[0;1]);\n   1.12956981510961487071711938292660776072226345893629e-6\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p2-exp(x),[0;1]);\n   1.12956980227478675612619255125474525171079325793124e-6\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p3-exp(x),[0;1]);\n   1.12956980227478675612619255125474525171079325793124e-6\n\nExample 4: \n   > L = [|exp(x), sin(x), cos(x)-1, sin(x^3)|];\n   > g = (2^x-1)/x;\n   > p1 = remez(g, L, [-1/16;1/16]);\n   > p2 = remez(g, 3, [-1/16;1/16]);\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p1 - g, [-1/16;1/16]);\n   9.8841323829271038137685646777951687620288462194745e-8\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p2 - g, [-1/16;1/16]);\n   2.54337800593461418356437401152248866818783932027105e-9\n\nExample 5: \n   > f = sin(x);\n   > I = [-3b-5;-1b-1074];\n   > time(popt = remez(1, [|1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9|], I, 1/f));\n   0.56120899999999999995317634393643402290763333439827\n   > time(p1 = remez(1, [|1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9|], I, 1/f, default, [0, 1b-73]));\n   0.34905900000000000002551431288466687874461058527231\n   > time(p2 = remez(1, [|1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9|], I, 1/f, default, [3b-72, +@Inf@]));\n   0.449890999999999999995996258217445529226097278296947\n   > dirtyinfnorm(popt/f-1, I);\n   2.06750931454112835098093903810531156576504665659064e-22\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p1/f-1, I);\n   2.49711266837493110470637913808914046704452778960875e-22\n   > dirtyinfnorm(p2/f-1, I);\n   5.4567247553615435246376977231253834265248756996947e-22\n   > 1b-73;\n   1.05879118406787542383540312584955245256423950195312e-22\n   > 3b-72;\n   6.3527471044072525430124187550973147153854370117187e-22\n\nSee also: dirtyinfnorm, infnorm, fpminimax, guessdegree, taylorform, taylor\n"

If supnorm succeeds in computing a suitable\n   interval r, which it returns, that interval is guaranteed to contain the\n   supremum norm value and to satisfy the required quality. Otherwise, supnorm\n   evaluates to error, displaying a corresponding error message. These failure\n   cases are rare and basically happen only for functions which are too\n   complicated.\n\n   * Roughly speaking, supnorm is based on taylorform to obtain a higher\n   degree polynomial approximation for {f}. This process is coupled with\n   an a posteriori validation of a potential supremum norm upper bound. \n   The validation is based on showing a certain polynomial the problem gets\n   reduced to does not vanish. In cases when this process alone does not \n   succeed, for instance because taylorform is unable to compute a \n   sufficiently good approximation to {f}, supnorm falls back to\n   bisecting the working interval until safe supremum norm bounds can be\n   computed with the required accuracy or until the width of the\n   subintervals becomes less than diam times the original interval {I}, \n   in which case supnorm fails.\n\n   * The algorithm used for supnorm is quite complex, which makes it impossible \n   to explain it here in further detail. \n   Please find a complete description in the following article:\n    \n      Sylvain Chevillard, John Harrison, Mioara Joldes, Christoph Lauter\n      Efficient and accurate computation of upper bounds of approximation errors\n      Journal of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), 2010\n      LIP Research Report number RR LIP2010-2\n      http://prunel.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ensl-00445343/fr/\n\n   * In practical cases, supnorm should be able to automatically handle\n   removable discontinuities that relative errors might have. This means\n   that usually, if {f} vanishes at a point x0 in the interval\n   considered, the approximation polynomial {p} is designed such that it\n   also vanishes at the same point with a multiplicity large\n   enough. Hence, although {f} vanishes, epsilon_relative=p/f-1 may be \n   defined by continuous extension at such points x0, called \n   removable discontinuities (see Example 3).\n\nExample 1: \n   > p = remez(exp(x), 5, [-1;1]);\n   > midpointmode=on!;\n   > supnorm(p, exp(x), [-1;1], absolute, 2^(-40));\n   0.45205513967~0/2~e-4\n\nExample 2: \n   > prec=200!;\n   > midpointmode=on!;\n   > d = [1;2];\n   > f = exp(cos(x)^2 + 1);\n   > p = remez(1,15,d,1/f,1e-40);\n   > theta=1b-60;\n   > prec=default!;\n   > mode=relative;\n   > supnorm(p,f,d,mode,theta);\n   0.30893006200251428~5/6~e-13\n\nExample 3: \n   > midpointmode=on!;\n   > mode=relative;\n   > theta=1b-135;\n   > d = [-1b-2;1b-2];\n   > f = expm1(x);\n   > p = x * (1 +  x * ( 2097145 * 2^(-22) + x * ( 349527 * 2^(-21) + x * (87609 * 2^(-21) + x * 4369 * 2^(-19))))); \n   > theta=1b-40;\n   > supnorm(p,f,d,mode,theta);\n   0.98349131972~2/3~e-7\n\nSee also: dirtyinfnorm, infnorm, checkinfnorm, absolute, relative, taylorform, autodiff, numberroots, diam\n"

If this parameter is omitted, the behavior is changed (see detailed description below).\n   {errorType} (optional) is the type of error to be considered. See the detailed description below. Default is absolute.\n\nDescription: \n   * WARNING: taylorform is a certified command, not difficult to use but not\n   completely straightforward to use either. In order to be sure to use it\n   correctly, the reader is invited to carefully read this documentation\n   entirely.\n\n   * taylorform computes an approximation polynomial and an interval error\n   bound for function f. \n   More precisely, it returns a list\n   L=[p, coeffErrors, Delta] where:\n    \n     - p is an approximation polynomial of degree n such that p(x-x0) is\n   roughly speaking a numerical Taylor expansion of f at the point x0.\n     - coeffsErrors is a list of n+1 intervals. Each interval coeffsErrors[i]\n   contains an enclosure of all the errors accumulated when computing the i-th\n   coefficient of p.\n     - Delta is an interval that provides a bound for the approximation error\n   between p and f. Its significance depends on the {errorType} considered.\n    \n\n   * The polynomial p and the bound  Delta are obtained using Taylor Models\n   principles.\n\n   * Please note that x0 can be an interval. In general, it is meant to be a\n   small interval approximating a non representable value. If x0 is given as a\n   constant expression, it is first numerically evaluated (leading to a faithful\n   rounding xapprox0 at precision prec), and it is then replaced by the (exactly\n   representable) point-interval [xapprox0, xapprox0]. In particular, it is not\n   the same to call taylorform with x0 = pi and with x0 = [pi], for instance.\n   In general, if the point around which one desires to compute the polynomial\n   is not exactly representable, one should preferably use a small interval\n   for x0.\n\n   * More formally, the mathematical property ensured by the algorithm may be\n   stated as follows. For all xi0 in x0, there exist (small) values\n   eps[i] in coeffsErrors[i] such that:\n    \n   If {errorType} is absolute, for all x in I, there exists delta in Delta such\n   that f(x) - p(x-xi0) = sum{i=0...n} eps[i]*(x-xi0)^i + delta.\n    \n   If {errorType} is relative, for all x in I, there exists delta in Delta such\n   that f(x) - p(x-xi0) = sum{i=0...n} eps[i]*(x-xi0)^i + delta*(x-xi0)^(n+1).\n\n   * It is also possible to use a large interval for x0, though it is not\n   obvious to give an intuitive sense to the result of taylorform in that case.\n   A particular case that might be interesting is when x0=I in relative mode.\n   In that case, denoting by p_i the coefficient of p of order i, the interval\n   p_i + coeffsError[i] gives an enclosure of f^(i)(I)/i!.\n   However, the command autodiff is more convenient for computing such\n   enclosures.\n\n   * When the interval I is not given, the approximated Taylor polynomial is\n   computed but no remainder is produced. In that case the returned list\n   is L=[p, coeffErrors].\n\n   * The relative case is especially useful when functions with removable\n   singularities are considered. In such a case, this routine is able to compute\n   a finite remainder bound, provided that the expansion point given is the\n   problematic removable singularity point.\n\n   * The algorithm does not guarantee that by increasing the degree of the\n   approximation, the remainder bound will become smaller. Moreover, it may \n   even become larger due to the dependecy phenomenon present with interval\n   arithmetic. In order to reduce this phenomenon, a possible solution is to\n   split the definition domain I into several smaller intervals. \n\n   * The command taylor also computes a Taylor polynomial of a function.

Every Sollya warning\n   or information message (that is not fatal to the tool's execution) has\n   a message number. When these message numbers {msg num 1} thru {msg num n} \n   are given to unsuppressmessage, the corresponding message are displayed\n   again, as they are by default at according verbosity levels. Actually,\n   the unsuppressmessage command just reverts the effects of the suppressmessage\n   command.\n\n   * Instead of giving unsuppressmessage several message numbers {msg num 1} thru\n   {msg num n} or calling unsuppressmessage several times, it is possible to give\n   a whole list {msg list} of message numbers to unsuppressmessage.\n\n   * The user should be aware that unsuppressmessage presents sticky behavior for\n   the warning and information messages suppressed from output.  In fact,\n   unsuppressmessage just unsuppresses the warning or information messages given\n   in argument.  All other suppressed messages stay suppressed until they\n   get unsuppressed by subsequent calls to unsuppressmessage or the Sollya tool\n   is restarted. This behavior distinguishes message suppression from\n   other global states of the Sollya tool. The user may use\n   getsuppressedmessages to obtain a list of currently suppressed\n   messages. In particular, in order to unsuppressed all currently\n   suppressed warning or information messages, the user may feed the\n   output of getsuppressedmessages (a list) into unsuppressmessage.\n\n   * The user should also note that unsuppressing warning or information\n   messages with unsuppressmessage just reverts the effects of the suppressmessage\n   command but that other conditions exist that affect the actual displaying \n   of a message, such as global verbosity (see verbosity) and modes\n   like rounding warnings (see roundingwarnings). A message will not just \n   get displayed because it was unsuppressed with unsuppressmessage.\n\n   * When unsuppressmessage is used on message numbers that do not exist in the\n   current version of the tool, a warning is displayed. The call has no\n   other effect though.\n\nExample 1: \n   > verbosity = 1;\n   The verbosity level has been set to 1.\n   > 0.1;\n   Warning: Rounding occurred when converting the constant \"0.1\" to floating-point with 165 bits.\n   If safe computation is needed, try to increase the precision.\n   0.1\n   > suppressmessage(174);\n   > 0.1;\n   0.1\n   > suppressmessage(174);\n   > 0.1;\n   0.1\n\nExample 2: \n   > verbosity = 12;\n   The verbosity level has been set to 12.\n   > showmessagenumbers = on; \n   Displaying of message numbers has been activated.\n   > diff(exp(x * 0.1));\n   Warning (174): Rounding occurred when converting the constant \"0.1\" to floating-point with 165 bits.\n   If safe computation is needed, try to increase the precision.\n   Information (196): formally differentiating a function.\n   Information (197): differentiating the expression 'exp(x * 0.1)'\n   Information (204): extraction of coefficient terms from a polynomial uses a special algorithm for Horner forms.\n   Information (207): no Horner simplification will be performed because the given tree is already in Horner form.\n   exp(x * 0.1) * 0.1\n   > suppressmessage([| 174, 207, 196 |]);\n   > diff(exp(x * 0.1));\n   Information (197): differentiating the expression 'exp(x * 0.1)'\n   Information (204): extraction of coefficient terms from a polynomial uses a special algorithm for Horner forms.\n   exp(x * 0.1) * 0.1\n   > unsuppressmessage([| 174, 196 |]);\n\nExample 3: \n   > verbosity = 12;\n   The verbosity level has been set to 12.\n   > showmessagenumbers = on;\n   Displaying of message numbers has been activated.\n   > suppressmessage(207, 387, 390, 388, 391, 196, 195, 197, 205);\n   > getsuppressedmessages();\n   [|195, 196, 197, 205, 207, 387, 388, 390, 391|]\n   > evaluate(x/sin(x) - 1, [-1;1]);\n   [0;0.85081571768092561791175324139865019347039665509409]\n   > unsuppressmessage(getsuppressedmessages());\n   > getsuppressedmessages();\n   [| |]\n\nSee also: getsuppressedmessages, suppressmessage, unsuppressmessage, verbosity, roundingwarnings\n"

#define HELP_VOID_TEXT "Name: void\n==> the functional result of a side-effect or empty argument resp. the corresponding type\n\nLibrary names:\n   sollya_obj_t sollya_lib_void()\n   int sollya_lib_is_void(sollya_obj_t)\n\nUsage: \n   void : void | type type\n\nDescription: \n   * The variable void represents the functional result of a\n   side-effect or an empty argument.  It is used only in combination with\n   the applications of procedures or identifiers bound through\n   externalproc to external procedures.\n    \n   The void result produced by a procedure or an external procedure\n   is not printed at the prompt. However, it is possible to print it out\n   in a print statement or in complex data types such as lists.\n    \n   The void argument is implicit when giving no argument to a\n   procedure or an external procedure when applied. It can nevertheless be given\n   explicitly.  For example, suppose that foo is a procedure or an\n   external procedure with a void argument. Then foo() and foo(void) are\n   correct calls to foo. Here, a distinction must be made for procedures having an\n   arbitrary number of arguments. In this case, an implicit void\n   as the only parameter to a call of such a procedure gets converted into \n   an empty list of arguments, an explicit void gets passed as-is in the\n   formal list of parameters the procedure receives.\n\n   * void is used also as a type identifier for\n   externalproc. Typically, an external procedure taking void as an\n   argument or returning void is bound with a signature void ->\n   some type or some type -> void. See externalproc for more\n   details.\n\nExample 1: \n   > print(void);\n   void\n   > void;\n\nExample 2: \n   > hey = proc() { print(\"Hello world.\"); };\n   > hey;\n   proc()\n   {\n   print(\"Hello world.\");\n   return void;\n   }\n   > hey();\n   Hello world.\n   > hey(void);\n   Hello world.\n   > print(hey());\n   Hello world.\n   void\n\nExample 3: \n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -Wall -c externalprocvoidexample.c\");\n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -shared -o externalprocvoidexample externalprocvoidexample.o\");\n   > externalproc(foo, \"./externalprocvoidexample\", void -> void);\n   > foo;\n   foo(void) -> void\n   > foo();\n   Hello from the external world.\n   > foo(void);\n   Hello from the external world.\n   > print(foo());\n   Hello from the external world.\n   void\n\nExample 4: \n   > procedure blub(L = ...) { print(\"Argument list:\", L); };\n   > blub(1);\n   Argument list: [|1|]\n   > blub();\n   Argument list: [| |]\n   > blub(void); \n   Argument list: [|void|]\n\nSee also: error, proc, externalproc\n"
